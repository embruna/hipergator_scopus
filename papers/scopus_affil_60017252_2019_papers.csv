We stratified analyses by apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) ϵ4 allele carrier status. Using linear mixed-effects models, elevated CHD risk in midlife (age 55 years) was associated with lower levels of general cognitive performance (β = -0.560 standard deviation (SD) units, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.874, -0.246), executive function (β = -0.624 SD units, 95% CI: -0.916, -0.332), and memory (β = -0.560 SD units, 95% CI: -0.907, -0.213) at age 70 years but not with rates of cognitive change. Late-life (age 70 years) elevated CHD risk, however, was associated with somewhat better levels of general cognitive performance and memory. There were associations between duration of elevated CHD risk during midlife and levels (but not trajectories) of later-life cognitive outcomes. Associations were not modified by APOE-ϵ4 status.

In addition, epithelial cells of the ChP (EChP) synthesize neurotrophic factors and other signaling molecules that are released into the CSF. Here, we show that insulin is produced in EChP of mice and humans, and its expression and release are regulated by serotonin. Insulin mRNA and immune-reactive protein, including C-peptide, are present in EChP, as detected by several experimental approaches, and appear in much higher levels than any other brain region. Moreover, insulin is produced in primary cultured mouse EChP, and its release, albeit Ca2+ sensitive, is not regulated by glucose. Instead, activation of the 5HT2C receptor by serotonin treatment led to activation of IP3-sensitive channels and Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular storage, leading to insulin secretion. In vivo depletion of brain serotonin in the dorsal raphe nucleus negatively affected insulin expression in the ChP, suggesting an endogenous modulation of ChP insulin by serotonin.

Although neuroinflammation serves to combat these threats and reinstate brain homeostasis, chronic inflammation can result in excessive cytokine production and cell death if the cause of inflammation remains. Overexpression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a proinflammatory cytokine with a central role in microglial activation, has been associated with neuronal excitotoxicity, synapse loss, and propagation of the inflammatory state. Thalidomide and its derivatives, termed immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs), are a class of drugs that target the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of TNF-α mRNA, inhibiting TNF-α production. Due to their multi-potent effects, several IMiDs, including thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide, have been repurposed as drug treatments for diseases such as multiple myeloma and psoriatic arthritis. Preclinical studies of currently marketed IMiDs, as well as novel IMiDs such as 3,6′-dithiothalidomide and adamantyl thalidomide derivatives, support the development of IMiDs as therapeutics for neurological disease. IMiDs have a competitive edge compared to similar anti-inflammatory drugs due to their blood-brain barrier permeability and high bioavailability, with the potential to alleviate symptoms of neurodegenerative disease and slow disease progression.

In this study, we used stratified LD score regression and expression-weighted cell-type enrichment together with several brain-related and cell-type-specific genomic annotations to connect human genomic PD findings to specific brain cell types. We found that PD heritability attributable to common variation does not enrich in global and regional brain annotations or brain-related cell-type-specific annotations.

In contrast, we demonstrated a significant enrichment of PD heritability in a curated lysosomal gene set highly expressed in astrocytic, microglial, and oligodendrocyte subtypes, and in LoF-intolerant genes, which were found highly expressed in almost all tested cellular subtypes.

Neuroinflammation and angiogenesis contribute to classical neuronal mechanisms underpinning the pathophysiology of l-dopa-induced dyskinesia, a motor complication associated with l-dopa therapy in Parkinson's disease. The efficacy of thalidomide and the more potent derivative 3,6′-dithiothalidomide on dyskinesia was tested in the 6-hydroxydopamine Parkinson's disease model. Methods: Three weeks after 6-hydroxydopamine infusion, rats received 10 days of treatment with l-dopa plus benserazide (6 mg/kg each) and thalidomide (70 mg/kg) or 3,6′-dithiothalidomide (56 mg/kg), and dyskinesia and contralateral turning were recorded daily. Rats were euthanized 1 hour after the last l-dopa injection, and levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-10, OX-42, vimentin, and vascular endothelial growth factor immunoreactivity were measured in their striatum and substantia nigra reticulata to evaluate neuroinflammation and angiogenesis. Striatal levels of GLUR1 were measured as a l-dopa-induced postsynaptic change that is under tumor necrosis factor-α control. Results: Thalidomide and 3,6′-dithiothalidomide significantly attenuated the severity of l-dopa-induced dyskinesia while not affecting contralateral turning. Moreover, both compounds inhibited the l-dopa-induced microgliosis and excessive tumor necrosis factor-α in the striatum and substantia nigra reticulata, while restoring physiological levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10. l-Dopa-induced angiogenesis was inhibited in both basal ganglia nuclei, and l-dopa-induced GLUR1 overexpression in the dorsolateral striatum was restored to normal levels.

This study aimed to assess the comparability of acceleration metrics between commonly-used body-attachment locations for 24 hours, waking and sleeping hours, and to test comparability of PA cut points between dominant and non-dominant wrist. Forty-five young adults (23 women, 18–41 years) were included and GT3X + accelerometers (ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL, USA) were placed on their right hip, dominant, and non-dominant wrist for 7 days. We derived Euclidean Norm Minus One g (ENMO), Low-pass filtered ENMO (LFENMO), Mean Amplitude Deviation (MAD) and ActiGraph activity counts over 5-second epochs from the raw accelerations. Metric values were compared using a correlation analysis, and by plotting the differences by time of the day. Cut points for the dominant wrist were derived using Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient optimization in a grid of possible thresholds, using the non-dominant wrist estimates as reference. They were cross-validated in a separate sample (N = 36, 10 women, 22–30 years). Shared variances between pairs of acceleration metrics varied across sites and metric pairs (range in r2: 0.19–0.97, all p < 0.01), suggesting that some sites and metrics are associated, and others are not. We observed higher metric values in dominant vs. non-dominant wrist, thus, we developed cut points for dominant wrist based on ENMO to classify sedentary time (<50 mg), light PA (50–110 mg), moderate PA (110–440 mg) and vigorous PA (≥440 mg). Our findings suggest differences between dominant and non-dominant wrist, and we proposed new cut points to attenuate these differences. ENMO and LFENMO were the most similar metrics, and they showed good comparability with MAD.

Further analyses included population-specific risk haplotype assessments, polygenic risk scoring through machine learning, Mendelian randomization of expression, and methylation data to gain insight into disease-associated loci, heritability estimates, genetic correlations, and burden analyses. Results: We identified a novel population-specific genome-wide association study signal at PARK2 associated with age at onset, which was likely dependent on the c.155delA mutation.

Objective: To apply Mendelian randomization between risk factors/phenotypic traits (exposures) and PD in a large, unbiased manner, and to create a public resource for research. Methods: We used two-sample Mendelian randomization in which the summary statistics relating to single-nucleotide polymorphisms from 5,839 genome-wide association studies of exposures were used to assess causal relationships with PD. We selected the highest-quality exposure genome-wide association studies for this report (n = 401). For the disease outcome, summary statistics from the largest published PD genome-wide association studies were used. For each exposure, the causal effect on PD was assessed using the inverse variance weighted method, followed by a range of sensitivity analyses. We used a false discovery rate of 5% from the inverse variance weighted analysis to prioritize exposures of interest. Results: We observed evidence for causal associations between 12 exposures and risk of PD. Of these, nine were effects related to increasing adiposity and decreasing risk of PD. The remaining top three exposures that affected PD risk were tea drinking, time spent watching television, and forced vital capacity, but these may have been biased and were less convincing. Other exposures at nominal statistical significance included inverse effects of smoking and alcohol. Conclusions: We present a new platform which offers Mendelian randomization analyses for a total of 5,839 genome-wide association studies versus the largest PD genome-wide association studies available (https://pdgenetics.shinyapps.io/MRportal/).

Examples of sex-specific differences include: (i) the relatively poor control of influenza virus infections in males compared to females, (ii) allergic asthma, an IgE-associated hypersensitivity reaction that is exacerbated in adolescent females compared to males, and (iii) systemic lupus erythematosus, a life-threatening autoimmune disease with a 9:1 female:male bias. Here we consider how estrogen and estrogen receptor α (ERα) may influence the immune response by modifying class switch recombination (CSR) and immunoglobulin expression patterns. We focus on ERα binding to enhancers (Eμ and the 3′ regulatory region) and switch sites (Sµ and Sε) in the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus. Our preliminary data from ChIP-seq analyses of purified, activated B cells show estrogen-mediated changes in the positioning of ERα binding within and near Sµ and Sε. In the presence of estrogen, ERα is bound not only to estrogen response elements (ERE), but also to adenosine-cytidine (AC)-repeats and poly adenosine (poly A) sequences, in some cases within constant region gene introns. We propose that by binding these sites, estrogen and ERα directly participate in the DNA loop formation required for CSR. We further suggest that estrogen regulates immunoglobulin expression patterns and can thereby influence life-and-death outcomes of infection, hypersensitivity, and autoimmune disease.",22,31703914,Journal,re,Review,100,10,10,NA,20712,NIH,P30 CA21765,National Institutes of Health,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,31,103996,S000887491930382X

We aimed to use the largest aggregate of GWAS data to identify novel risk loci and gain further insight into the causes of Parkinson's disease. Methods: We did a meta-analysis of 17 datasets from Parkinson's disease GWAS available from European ancestry samples to nominate novel loci for disease risk. These datasets incorporated all available data. We then used these data to estimate heritable risk and develop predictive models of this heritability. We also used large gene expression and methylation resources to examine possible functional consequences as well as tissue, cell type, and biological pathway enrichments for the identified risk factors. Additionally, we examined shared genetic risk between Parkinson's disease and other phenotypes of interest via genetic correlations followed by Mendelian randomisation. Findings: Between Oct 1, 2017, and Aug 9, 2018, we analysed 7·8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms in 37 688 cases, 18 618 UK Biobank proxy-cases (ie, individuals who do not have Parkinson's disease but have a first degree relative that does), and 1·4 million controls. We identified 90 independent genome-wide significant risk signals across 78 genomic regions, including 38 novel independent risk signals in 37 loci. These 90 variants explained 16–36% of the heritable risk of Parkinson's disease depending on prevalence. Integrating methylation and expression data within a Mendelian randomisation framework identified putatively associated genes at 70 risk signals underlying GWAS loci for follow-up functional studies. Tissue-specific expression enrichment analyses suggested Parkinson's disease loci were heavily brain-enriched, with specific neuronal cell types being implicated from single cell data. We found significant genetic correlations with brain volumes (false discovery rate-adjusted p=0·0035 for intracranial volume, p=0·024 for putamen volume), smoking status (p=0·024), and educational attainment (p=0·038). Mendelian randomisation between cognitive performance and Parkinson's disease risk showed a robust association (p=8·00 × 10−7). Interpretation: These data provide the most comprehensive survey of genetic risk within Parkinson's disease to date, to the best of our knowledge, by revealing many additional Parkinson's disease risk loci, providing a biological context for these risk factors, and showing that a considerable genetic component of this disease remains unidentified. These associations derived from European ancestry datasets will need to be followed-up with more diverse data.

Methods: We accumulated individual data from 12 longitudinal cohorts in a total of 4093 patients with 22,307 observations for a median of 3.81 years. Genomewide associations were evaluated for 25 cross-sectional and longitudinal phenotypes. Specific variants of interest, including 90 recently identified disease-risk variants, were also investigated post hoc for candidate associations with these phenotypes. Results: Two variants were genomewide significant.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. PARTICIPANTS: Men and women, aged 22 to 101 years, without cognitive impairment, dementia, stroke, Parkinson disease, resting tremor, abnormal muscle tone, or abnormal coordination (N = 507). MEASUREMENTS: Bimanual gesture imitation was measured using a test validated in older adults. We assessed (1) cognition, including verbal memory, executive function, attention, visuospatial ability, visuoperceptual speed, and language; (2) manual dexterity with the Purdue Pegboard Test; (3) olfaction, using the 16-item Sniffin' Sticks Identification Test; (4) upper extremity motor function, using a computer-based finger tapping test; and (5) lower extremity motor function, including 6-meter usual and rapid gait speeds, 400-meter walk time, Health ABC Physical Performance Battery, and total standing balance time. Cross-sectional associations between bimanual gesture imitation performance and each measure were examined using linear regression after adjustment for age, sex, race, education, and body mass index. Models with mobility measures also adjusted for height. RESULTS: Higher gesture imitation performance was associated with younger age. After adjustment, a worse score was associated with worse olfaction, executive function, and visuospatial ability. Gesture imitation score was not associated with other cognitive measures or motor function. CONCLUSION: In persons without clinically detectable neurological conditions, poor bimanual gesture imitation is associated with other indicators of brain health, including olfaction and selected cognitive function domains.

Previous genetic studies of svPPA are limited by small sample sizes and a paucity of common risk variants. Despite this, svPPA’s relatively homogenous clinicopathologic phenotype makes it an ideal investigative model to examine genetic processes that may drive neurodegenerative disease. In this study, we used GWAS metadata, tissue samples from pathologically confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and in silico techniques to identify and characterize protein interaction networks associated with svPPA risk. We identified 64 svPPA risk genes that interact at the protein level. The protein pathways represented in this svPPA gene network are critical regulators of RNA metabolism and cell death, such as SMAD proteins and NOTCH1. Many of the genes in this network are involved in TDP-43 metabolism. Contrary to the conventional notion that svPPA is a clinical syndrome with few genetic risk factors, our analyses show that svPPA risk is complex and polygenic in nature.

These neuronal network and behavioral adaptations require the mitochondrial protein deacetylase SIRT3 as they are abolished in SIRT3-deficient mice and wild type mice in which SIRT3 is selectively depleted from hippocampal neurons. In the App NL-G-F mouse model of AD, IF reduces neuronal network hyperexcitability and ameliorates deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity in a SIRT3-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate a role for a mitochondrial protein deacetylase in hippocampal neurons in behavioral and GABAergic synaptic adaptations to IF.",135,31015456,Journal,ar,Article,100,15,15,NA,19700182758,NIA,undefined,National Institute on Aging,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,58,1886,NA

PTI-00703 cat’s claw (Uncaria tomentosa from a specific Peruvian source), a specific and natural plant extract from the Amazon rain forest, was identified as a potent inhibitor and reducer of both beta-amyloid fibrils (the main component of “plaques”) and tau protein paired helical filaments/fibrils (the main component of “tangles”). PTI-00703 cat’s claw demonstrated both the ability to prevent formation/aggregation and disaggregate preformed Aβ fibrils (1–42 and 1–40) and tau protein tangles/filaments. The disaggregation/dissolution of Aβ fibrils occurred nearly instantly when PTI-00703 cat’s claw and Aβ fibrils were mixed together as shown by a variety of methods including Thioflavin T fluorometry, Congo red staining, Thioflavin S fluorescence and electron microscopy. Sophisticated structural elucidation studies identified the major fractions and specific constituents within PTI-00703 cat’s claw responsible for both the observed “plaque” and “tangle” inhibitory and reducing activity. Specific proanthocyanidins (i.e. epicatechin dimers and variants thereof) are newly identified polyphenolic components within Uncaria tomentosa that possess both “plaque and tangle” reducing and inhibitory activity. One major identified specific polyphenol within PTI-00703 cat’s claw was epicatechin-4β-8-epicatechin (i.e. an epicatechin dimer known as proanthocyanidin B2) that markedly reduced brain plaque load and improved short-term memory in younger and older APP “plaque-producing” (TASD-41) transgenic mice (bearing London and Swedish mutations).

Our fund of knowledge of the foundational genetics in disease has never been as great. There is a clear path forward to the resolution of the genetic architecture toward a point at which we will saturate the biological understanding of disease through genetics. This understanding continues to provide fundamental insights into disease biology and, with the advent of new data and methodologies, the path from gene to function is becoming clearer and cleaner. In this opinion piece, we discuss progress in the genetics of Parkinson disease. We explore what genetics has revealed thus far in the context of disease biology. We highlight mitophagy/autophagy, dopamine metabolism and the adaptive immune system. We try and link these findings together to give a holistic view of pathogenesis with the underlying theme that disease pathogenesis relates to a failure of damage response pathways. In the 1990s, Parkinson's disease was regarded a non-genetic disorder. Since that time, however, a huge number of Mendelian loci and risk loci have been identified by positional cloning and by genome-wide association studies.

METHODS: We conducted a case-control genome-wide association study of aTRH among persons treated for hypertension, using data from 10 cohorts of European ancestry (EA) and 5 cohorts of African ancestry (AA). Cases were treated with 3 different antihypertensive medication classes and had blood pressure (BP) above goal (systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg) or 4 or more medication classes regardless of BP control (nEA = 931, nAA = 228). Both a normotensive control group and a treatment-responsive control group were considered in separate analyses. Normotensive controls were untreated (nEA = 14,210, nAA = 2,480) and had systolic BP/diastolic BP < 140/90 mm Hg. Treatment-responsive controls (nEA = 5,266, nAA = 1,817) had BP at goal (<140/90 mm Hg), while treated with one antihypertensive medication class. Individual cohorts used logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, study site, and principal components for ancestry to examine the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms with case-control status. Inverse variance-weighted fixed-effects meta-analyses were carried out using METAL. RESULTS: The known hypertension locus, CASZ1, was a top finding among EAs (P = 1.1 × 10-8) and in the race-combined analysis (P = 1.5 × 10-9) using the normotensive control group (rs12046278, odds ratio = 0.71 (95% confidence interval: 0.6-0.8)). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in this locus were robustly replicated in the Million Veterans Program (MVP) study in consideration of a treatment-responsive control group.

Capitalizing on multi-modal brain imaging approaches, we used simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potential (ERP) recordings, to investigate the link between spatial and temporal aspects of processing in an emotional oddball task, and in relation to personality measures reflecting basic affective responses and emotion control. First, fMRI captured expected dorso-ventral dissociations, with greater response to targets in regions of dorsal brain networks (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and to emotional distracters in regions of ventral networks (e.g., ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, vlPFC). Also, ERP responses to targets were associated with a prominent P300, and responses to distracters with the late positive potential (LPP). Second, providing evidence for spatio-temporal integration of brain signals, ERP-informed fMRI analyses showed a link between LPP amplitude at parietal electrodes and the fMRI signal in the vlPFC, to emotional distraction. Third, regarding the link to personality measures, increased emotional arousability and attentional impulsiveness was associated with greater LPP differences between negative distracters and targets and enhanced response to negative distracters in the amygdala, respectively. Furthermore, we identified opposing relations between responses to emotional distraction and individual scores for cognitive reappraisal and self-control impulsiveness in posterior vlPFC. This suggests a greater engagement of this region in participants with reduced tendencies to employ reappraisal as a coping strategy and those with reduced ability to control impulsive responses during emotional distraction.

Accurate characterization of stimulus-specific and tissue-specific dimer repertoires is fundamentally important for understanding the downstream gene regulation by NF-κB proteins. In vitro assays such as immunoprecipitation have been widely used to analyze subunit composition, but these methods do not provide information about dimerization status within the natural intracellular environment of intact live cells.

We previously reported that, in proliferating human cells, p53 transiently moves to centrosomes at each mitosis. Such p53 mitotic centrosome localization (p53-MCL) occurs independently from DNA damage but requires ATM-mediated p53Ser15 phosphorylation (p53Ser15P) on discrete cytoplasmic p53 foci that, through MT dynamics, move to centrosomes during the mitotic spindle formation. Here, we show that inhibition of p53-MCL, obtained by p53 depletion or selective impairment of p53 centrosomal localization, induces centrosome fragmentation in human nontransformed cells. In contrast, tumor cells or mouse cells tolerate p53 depletion, as expected, and p53-MCL inhibition. Such tumor- and species-specific behavior of centrosomal p53 resembles that of the recently identified sensor of centrosome-loss, whose activation triggers the mitotic surveillance pathway in human nontransformed cells but not in tumor cells or mouse cells. The mitotic surveillance pathway prevents the growth of human cells with increased chance of making mitotic errors and accumulating numeral chromosome defects. Thus, we evaluated whether p53-MCL could work as a centrosome-loss sensor and contribute to the activation of the mitotic surveillance pathway. We provide evidence that centrosome-loss triggered by PLK4 inhibition makes p53 orphan of its mitotic dock and promotes accumulation of discrete p53Ser15P foci. These p53 foci are required for the recruitment of 53BP1, a key effector of the mitotic surveillance pathway. Consistently, cells from patients with constitutive impairment of p53-MCL, such as ATM- and PCNT-mutant carriers, accumulate numeral chromosome defects.

Methods: Meta-analyses of six Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium (n = 19 005) tested interactions between SFA and NLRP3-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and modulation of fasting insulin, fasting glucose, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance. Results: SFA interacted with rs12143966, wherein each 1% increase in SFA intake increased insulin by 0.0063 IU mL−1 (SE ± 0.002, p = 0.001) per each major (G) allele copy. rs4925663, interacted with SFA (β ± SE = −0.0058 ± 0.002, p = 0.004) to increase insulin by 0.0058 IU mL−1, per additional copy of the major (C) allele.

Where the evidence-base was limited or of low quality, Consensus Based Recommendations (CBRs) were formulated. The recommendations focus on the clinical and practical aspects of care for older people with frailty, and promote person-centred care. Recommendations for Screening and Assessment: The task force recommends that health practitioners case identify/screen all older adults for frailty using a validated instrument suitable for the specific setting or context (strong recommendation). Ideally, the screening instrument should exclude disability as part of the screening process. For individuals screened as positive for frailty, a more comprehensive clinical assessment should be performed to identify signs and underlying mechanisms of frailty (strong recommendation). Recommendations for Management: A comprehensive care plan for frailty should address polypharmacy (whether rational or nonrational), the management of sarcopenia, the treatable causes of weight loss, and the causes of exhaustion (depression, anaemia, hypotension, hypothyroidism, and B12 deficiency) (strong recommendation). All persons with frailty should receive social support as needed to address unmet needs and encourage adherence to a comprehensive care plan (strong recommendation). First-line therapy for the management of frailty should include a multi-component physical activity programme with a resistance-based training component (strong recommendation).

Oxylipins are increasingly being measured in plasma collected in clinical studies to investigate biological mechanisms and as pharmacodynamic biomarkers for nutrient-based and drug-based interventions. Whole blood is generally stored either on ice or at room temperature prior to processing. However, the potential impacts of delays in processing, and of temperature prior to processing, on oxylipin concentrations are incompletely understood. Objective: To evaluate the effects of delayed processing of blood samples in a timeframe that is typical of a clinical laboratory setting, using typical storage temperatures, on concentrations of representative unesterified oxylipins measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Design: Whole blood (drawn on three separate occasions from a single person) was collected into 5 mL purple-top potassium-EDTA tubes and stored for 0, 10, 20, 30, 60 or 120 min at room temperature or on wet ice, followed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min with plasma collection. Each sample was run in duplicate, therefore there were six tubes and up to six data points at each time point for each oxylipin at each condition (ice/room temperature). Representative oxylipins derived from arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and linoleic acid were quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Longitudinal models were used to estimate differences between temperature groups 2 h after blood draw. Results: We found that most oxylipins measured in human plasma in traditional potassium-EDTA tubes are reasonably stable when stored on ice for up to 2 h prior to processing, with little evidence of auto-oxidation in either condition. By contrast, in whole blood stored at room temperature, substantial time-dependent increases in the 12-lipoxygenase-derived (12-HETE, 14-HDHA) and platelet-derived (thromboxane B2) oxylipins were observed. Conclusion: These findings suggest that certain plasma oxylipins can be measured with reasonable accuracy despite delayed processing for up to 2 h when blood is stored on ice prior to centrifugation. 12-Lipoxygenase- and platelet-derived oxylipins may be particularly sensitive to post-collection artifact with delayed processing at room temperature.

Objective: To validate nEV biomarkers as AD predictors. Design, Setting, Participants: This case-control study included longitudinal plasma samples from cognitively normal participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) cohort who developed AD up to January 2015 and age- and sex-matched controls who remained cognitively normal over a similar length of follow-up. Repeated samples were blindly analyzed over 1 year from participants with clinical AD and controls from the Johns Hopkins Alzheimer Disease Research Center (JHADRC).

Main Outcomes and Measures: Neuronal-enriched extracellular vesicles were immunoprecipitated; tau, Aβ42, and IRS-1 biomarkers were quantified by immunoassays; and nEV concentration and diameter were determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis. Levels and longitudinal trajectories of nEV biomarkers between participants with future AD and control participants were compared. Results: Overall, 887 longitudinal plasma samples from 128 BLSA participants who eventually developed AD and 222 age and sex-matched controls who remained cognitively normal were analyzed.

To address this unmet need, the International Sepsis Forum convened a colloquium in February 2018 titled “Understanding and Enhancing Sepsis Survivorship.” The goals were to identify gaps and limitations of current research and shorter- and longer-term priorities for understanding and enhancing sepsis survivorship. Twenty-six experts from eight countries participated.

Immunoneutralization of marinobufagenin reduces blood pressure in Dahl salt-sensitive (Dahl-S) rats. The effect of the anti-marinobufagenin monoclonal antibody on blood pressure, left ventricular (LV) and renal remodeling, and gene expression were investigated in hypertensive Dahl-S rats. Methods and Results: Dahl-S rats were fed high NaCl (8%, HS; n=14) or low NaCl (0.1%, LS; n=14) diets for 8 weeks. Animals were administered control antibody (LS control antibody, LSC; HS control antibody, HSC; n=7 per group) or anti-marinobufagenin antibody once on week 7 of diet intervention (n=7 per group). Levels of marinobufagenin, LV, and kidney mRNAs and proteins implicated in profibrotic signaling were assessed. Systolic blood pressure was elevated (211±8 versus 133±3 mm Hg, P<0.01), marinobufagenin increased 2-fold in plasma (P<0.05) and 5-fold in urine (P<0.01), LV and kidney weights increased, and levels of LV collagen-1 rose 3.5-fold in HSC versus LSC. Anti-marinobufagenin antibody treatment decreased systolic blood pressure by 24 mm Hg (P<0.01) and reduced organ weights and level of LV collagen-1 (P<0.01) in hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive rats with anti-marinobufagenin antibody versus HSC. The expression of genes related to transforming growth factor-β–dependent signaling was upregulated in the left ventricles and kidneys in HSC versus LSC groups and became downregulated following administration of anti-marinobufagenin antibody to hypertensive Dahl-S rats. Marinobufagenin also activated transforming growth factor-β signaling in cultured ventricular myocytes from Dahl-S rats. Conclusions: Immunoneutralization of heightened marinobufagenin levels in hypertensive Dahl-S rats resulted in a downregulation of genes implicated in transforming growth factor-β pathway, which indicates that marinobufagenin is an activator of profibrotic transforming growth factor-β–dependent signaling in salt-sensitive hypertension.",15,31576777,Journal,ar,Article,100,14,14,cardiac hypertrophy | Dahl salt-sensitive hypertension | marinobufagenin | monoclonal antibody | transforming growth factor,21100246515,NIH,undefined,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,103,e012138,NA

Our objective is to determine if EDS is related to brain Lewy pathology (LP), a marker of PD pathogenesis, using clinical assessments of EDS with postmortem follow-up. METHODS: Identification of LP was based on staining for α-synuclein in multiple brain regions in a sample of 211 men. Data on EDS were collected at clinical examinations from 1991 to 1999 when participants were aged 72-97 years. RESULTS: Although EDS was more common in the presence vs absence of LP (p = 0.034), the association became stronger in neocortical regions. When LP was limited to the olfactory bulb, brainstem, and basal forebrain (Braak stages 1-4), frequency of EDS was 10% (4/40) vs 17.5% (20/114) in decedents without LP (p = 0.258). In contrast, compared to the absence of LP, EDS frequency doubled (36.7% [11/30], p = 0.023) when LP reached the anterior cingulate gyrus, insula mesocortex, and midfrontal, midtemporal, and inferior parietal neocortex (Braak stage 5). With further infiltration into the primary motor and sensory neocortices (Braak stage 6), EDS frequency increased threefold (51.9% [14/27], p < 0.001). Findings were similar across sleep-related features and persisted after adjustment for age and other covariates, including the removal of PD and dementia with Lewy bodies. CONCLUSIONS: The association between EDS and PD includes relationships with extensive topographic LP expansion.

Recent work using principal component analysis (PCA) of multisystem biomarkers proposed a novel fundamental physiological process, ""integrated albunemia,"" which was consistent across human populations and more strongly associated with age and mortality risk than individual biomarkers. Here we tested for integrated albunemia and associations with age and mortality across six diverse nonhuman primate species and humans. PCA of 13 physiological biomarkers recovered in all species a primary axis of variation (PC1) resembling integrated albunemia, which increased with age in all but one species but was less predictive of mortality risk. Within species, PC1 scores were often reliably recovered with a minimal biomarker subset and usually stable between sexes. Even among species, correlations in PC1 structure were often strong, but the effect of phylogeny was inconclusive. Thus, integrated albunemia likely reflects an evolutionarily conserved process across primates and appears to be generally associated with aging but not necessarily with negative impacts on survival.

Deep investigation of the region resulted in one identified variant, the rs34311866 missense SNP (p.M393T) in TMEM175, which is 20 orders of magnitude more significant than any other SNP in the region. Because TMEM175 is a lysosomal gene that has been shown to influence α-synuclein phosphorylation and autophagy, the p.M393T variant is an attractive candidate, and we have examined its effect on TMEM175 protein and PD-related biology. After knocking down each of the genes located under the GWAS peak via multiple shRNAs, only TMEM175 was found to consistently influence accumulation of phosphorylated α-synuclein (p-α-syn). Examination of the p.M393T variant showed effects on TMEM175 function that were intermediate between the wild-type (WT) and knockout phenotypes, with reduced regulation of lysosomal pH in response to starvation and minor changes in clearance of autophagy substrates, reduced lysosomal localization, and increased accumulation of p-α-syn. Finally, overexpression of WT TMEM175 protein reduced p-α-syn, while overexpression of the p.M393T variant resulted in no change in α-synuclein phosphorylation. These results suggest that the main signal in the chromosome 4p16.3 PD risk locus is driven by the TMEM175 p.M393T variant.

The original definition was a “muscle loss” of the appendicular muscle mass in the older people as measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). In 2010, the definition was altered to be low muscle mass together with low muscle function and this was agreed upon as reported in a number of consensus papers. The Society of Sarcopenia, Cachexia and Wasting Disorders supports the recommendations of more recent consensus conferences, i.e. that rapid screening, such as with the SARC-F questionnaire, should be utilized with a formal diagnosis being made by measuring grip strength or chair stand together with DXA estimation of appendicular muscle mass (indexed for height2). Assessments of the utility of ultrasound and creatine dilution techniques are ongoing. Use of ultrasound may not be easily reproducible. Primary sarcopenia is aging associated (mediated) loss of muscle mass. Secondary sarcopenia (or disease-related sarcopenia) has predominantly focused on loss of muscle mass without the emphasis on muscle function. Diseases that can cause muscle wasting (i.e. secondary sarcopenia) include malignant cancer, COPD, heart failure, and renal failure and others. Management of sarcopenia should consist of resistance exercise in combination with a protein intake of 1 to 1.5 g/kg/day. There is insufficient evidence that vitamin D and anabolic steroids are beneficial. These recommendations apply to both primary (age-related) sarcopenia and secondary (disease related) sarcopenia. Secondary sarcopenia also needs appropriate treatment of the underlying disease. It is important that primary care health professionals become aware of and make the diagnosis of age-related and disease-related sarcopenia. It is important to address the risk factors for sarcopenia, particularly low physical activity and sedentary behavior in the general population, using a life-long approach.

However, studies of peripheral insulin resistance using the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) or oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) suggest that abnormal glucose metabolism is already present in drug-naive first-episode schizophrenia (DNFES). We hypothesized impairments of neuronal insulin signaling in DNFES. Methods: To gain insight into neuronal insulin-signaling in vivo, we analyzed peripheral blood extracellular vesicles enriched for neuronal origin (nEVs). Phosphorylated insulin signal transduction serine-threonine kinases pS312-IRS-1, pY-IRS-1, pS473-AKT, pS9-GSK3β, pS2448-mTOR, pT389-p70S6K and respective total protein levels were determined in plasma nEVs from 48 DNFES patients and healthy matched controls after overnight fasting. Results: Upstream pS312-IRS-1 was reduced at trend level (p = 0.071; this condition may amplify IRS-1 signaling). Exploratory omnibus analysis of downstream serine-threonine kinases (AKT, GSK3β, mTOR, p70S6K) revealed lower phosphorylated/total protein ratios in DNFES vs. controls (p = 0.013), confirming decreased pathway activation. Post-hoc-tests indicated in particular a reduced phosphorylation ratio of mTOR (p = 0.027). Phosphorylation ratios of p70S6K (p = 0.029), GSK3β (p = 0.039), and at trend level AKT (p = 0.061), showed diagnosis-dependent statistical interactions with insulin blood levels. The phosphorylation ratio of AKT correlated inversely with PANSS-G and PANSS-total scores, and other ratios showed similar trends. Conclusion: These findings support the hypothesis of neuronal insulin resistance in DNFES, small sample sizes notwithstanding.

The DASH diet, fiber, and magnesium were negatively correlated with allostatic load, whereas allostatic load predicted higher all-cause mortality, irrespective of the DASH diet. Whereas protein was protective, potassium increased all-cause mortality risk, irrespective of allostatic load. Potassium was protective against cardiovascular disease-specific mortality but was a risk factor for cancer-specific mortality. Although no moderating effects were observed, mediation by the allostatic load on cardiovascular disease-specific mortality was observed for DASH total score and selected component scores. Direct (but not indirect) effects of DASH through the allostatic load were observed for all-cause mortality, and no direct or indirect effects were observed for cancer-specific mortality. From a public health standpoint, the allostatic load may be a surrogate for the preventive effects of the DASH diet and its components on cardiovascular disease-specific mortality risk.",34,31569527,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Allostatic load | Diet | Hypertension | Mortality | Survey,19700188323,NIH,undefined,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,116,2311,NA

To assess the main effects of the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan and ω-3 as fish oil on IL-6 and 400 m walking speed, we conducted the ENRGISE Pilot multicenter randomized clinical trial. Methods: The ENRGISE Pilot enrolled participants between April 2016 and June 2017, who participated for 12 months.

Therefore, the objective of our study was to prospectively evaluate sex differences in frailty, assessed by the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) and mortality, institutionalization, and re-hospitalization in an international cohort of older people admitted to hospital. Study design: We used data from nine public hospitals in Europe and Australia, to evaluate sex differences in mortality, frailty and the risk of institutionalization and re-hospitalization, during one year of follow-up. Main outcome measures: People aged 65 years or more admitted to hospital for an acute medical condition or for a relapse of a chronic disease were included. A standardized comprehensive geriatric assessment, which evaluated functional, nutritional, and cognitive status, risk of pressure sores, comorbidities, medications and co-habitation status, was used to calculate the MPI to measure frailty in all hospitalized older people.

However, many initial positive findings in schizophrenia research are not later replicated. Objective: To independently replicate the results of the effect of estradiol on schizophrenia in women of childbearing age. Design, Setting, and Participants: An 8-week randomized, placebo-controlled trial performed in the Republic of Moldova between December 4, 2015, and July 29, 2016, among 200 premenopausal women aged 19 to 46 years with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder as defined by the DSM-5. Intervention: Patients were randomized to receive a 200-μg estradiol patch or placebo patch changed twice a week added to their antipsychotic treatment. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the positive subscale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; lower scores indicated fewer symptoms and higher scores indicated more symptoms), analyzed with mixed models for repeated measures on an intention-to-treat basis. Results: A total of 100 women (median age, 38 years; interquartile range, 34-42 years) were randomized to receive an estradiol patch and 100 women (median age, 38 years; interquartile range, 31-41 years) were randomized to receive a placebo patch; the median age at baseline for the entire group of 200 women was 38.0 years (range, 19.5-46.0 years). At baseline, the mean positive PANSS score was 19.6 for both groups combined; at week 8, the mean positive PANSS score was 14.4 in the placebo group and 13.4 in the estradiol group. Compared with placebo, participants receiving add-on estradiol patches had statistically significant improvements in the primary outcome measure, PANSS positive subscale points (-0.94; 95% CI, -1.64 to -0.24; P =.008; effect size = 0.38). Post hoc heterogeneity analyses found that this effect occurred almost entirely in 100 participants older than 38.0 years (46 in placebo group vs 54 in estradiol group; difference, -1.98 points on the PANSS positive subscale; 95% CI, -2.94 to -1.02; P <.001). Younger participants did not benefit from estradiol (difference, 0.08 points on the PANSS positive subscale; 95% CI, -0.91 to 1.07; P =.87). Breast tenderness was more common in the estradiol group (n = 15) than in the placebo group (n = 1) as was weight gain (14 in estradiol group vs 1 in placebo group). Conclusions and Relevance: The results independently replicate the finding that transdermal estradiol is an effective add-on treatment for women of childbearing age with schizophrenia and extend it, finding improvements in negative symptoms and finding that the effect could be specific to those older than 38 years. The results should be viewed in the context of the differences in the natural course of schizophrenia between females and males.

To identify a uric acid threshold above which cardiovascular mortality rises, we studied the relationship between uric acid concentration and overall/cardiovascular mortality. Methods and results: We analyzed data from the InCHIANTI study, a cohort study of Italian community-dwelling people with 9 years of follow-up. We selected a sample of 947 individuals over 64 years of age, free from cardio-cerebrovascular disease and with available uric acid measurement at baseline. The sample was divided according to plasma uric acid tertiles. The Hazard ratio (HR) for mortality was calculated by multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. Mean age of participants was 75.3 ± 7.3 years; the mean value of uric acid was 5.1 ± 1.4 mg/dl. Over 9-years of follow-up, 342 (36.1%) participants died, 143 deaths (15.1%) were due to cardiovascular disease. Subjects with higher uric acid concentrations presented a higher cardiovascular mortality [II (4.6–5.5 mg/dl) vs I (1.8–4.5 mg/dl) tertile HR: 1.98, 95%C.I. 1.22–3.23; III (≥5.6 mg/dl) vs I tertile HR: 1.87, 95%C.I. 1.13–3.09].

TBI-derived neuropathologies are promoted by inflammatory processes: chronic microgliosis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that further promote neuronal dysfunction and loss. Herein, we evaluated the effect on pre-programmed cell death/neuroinflammation/synaptic integrity and function of (-)-Phenserine tartrate (Phen), an agent originally developed for AD. This was studied at two clinically translatable doses (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg, BID), in a weight drop (concussive) mTBI model in wild type (WT) and AD APP/PSEN1 transgenic mice. Phen mitigated mTBI-induced cognitive impairment, assessed by Novel Object Recognition and Y-maze behavioral paradigms, in WT mice. Phen fully abated mTBI-induced neurodegeneration, evaluated by counting Fluoro-Jade C-positive (FJC+) cells, in hippocampus and cortex of WT mice. In APP/PSEN1 mice, degenerating cell counts were consistently greater across all experimental groups vs. WT mice. mTBI elevated FJC+ cell counts vs. the APP/PSEN1 control (sham) group, and Phen similarly mitigated this. Anti-inflammatory effects on microglial activation (IBA1-immunoreactivity (IR)) and the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α were evaluated. mTBI increased IBA1-IR and TNF-α/IBA1 colocalization vs. sham, both in WT and APP/PSEN1 mice. Phen decreased IBA1-IR throughout hippocampi and cortices of WT mice, and in cortices of AD mice. Phen, likewise, reduced levels of IBA1/TNF-α-IR colocalization volume across all areas in WT animals, with a similar trend in APP/PSEN1 mice. Actions on astrocyte activation by mTBI were followed by evaluating GFAP, and were similarly mitigated by Phen. Synaptic density was evaluated by quantifying PSD-95+ dendritic spines and Synaptophysin (Syn)-IR. Both were significantly reduced in mTBI vs. sham in both WT and APP/PSEN1 mice. Phen fully reversed the PSD-95+ spine loss in WT and Syn-IR decrease in both WT and APP/PSEN1 mice. To associate immunohistochemical changes in synaptic markers with function, hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) was induced in WT mice. LTP was impaired by mTBI, and this impairment was mitigated by Phen. In synopsis, clinically translatable doses of Phen ameliorated mTBI-mediated pre-programmed cell death/neuroinflammation/synaptic dysfunction in WT mice, consistent with fully mitigating mTBI-induced cognitive impairments.

Muscle strength and body composition change over time, but their changes differ by sex. How these parameters jointly affect gait speed decline is unknown. Understanding this association could help develop and evaluate the sex-specific effects of lifestyle interventions to delay gait speed decline in older adults. We assessed whether changes in strength (Δstrength), appendicular lean mass (ΔALM), and fat mass (Δfat) jointly relate to change in gait speed and whether the association differs by sex. Methods: The analytic sample comprised 575 women and 539 men aged 22–95 years enrolled in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Mean follow-up was 4.0 years. Measures included isometric knee extension strength, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-assessed ALM and fat mass, and gait speed from the 400 m fast pace walk. Sex-specific linear mixed models were adjusted for follow-up time and baseline age, race, height, ALM, fat mass, peak torque, and gait speed. We also included second-order interaction terms of the key predictive variables (e.g. Δstrength × ΔALM). To interpret the interactions, we estimated average gait declines using the 25th or 75th percentile of the two significant predictive variables and then assessed which condition relates to larger decline in gait speed. Results: In both sexes, independent of ΔALM and Δfat, larger decline in strength significantly related to larger decline in gait speed (P = 0.01 for both sexes). In men, interactions between Δstrength × ΔALM and Δfat by ΔALM were associated with change in gait speed; men with greater declines in both muscle strength and ALM or greater declines in both ALM and fat have steeper gait speed decline. In contrast, in women, the interaction between Δfat and ΔALM was associated with change in gait speed; women with an increase in fat mass combined with less decline in ALM have steeper gait speed decline. Conclusions: While change in strength affects change in gait speed in both sexes, the effects of body composition change differ by sex. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-based estimates of lean mass may be confounded by intramuscular fat. Future studies should examine sex-specific combined effects of change in strength and body composition on mobility using multiple techniques to measure body composition.

Methods: White and African–American adult participants in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study for whom DNA samples were analyzed (baseline age: 30–65 years) we included. We estimated three DNAm based EAA measures: (1) universal epigenetic age acceleration (AgeAccel); (2) intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (IEAA); and (3) extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (EEAA). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale total and sub-domain scores at baseline (2004–2009) and follow-up visits (2009–2013). Linear mixed-effects regression models were conducted, adjusting potentially confounding covariates, selection bias and multiple testing (N = 329 participants, ∼52% men, k = 1.9 observations/participant, mean follow-up time∼4.7 years). Results: None of the epigenetic age acceleration measures were associated with total depressive symptom scores at baseline or over time.

The mechanisms of HAND in the aged population are not completely understood; a leading hypothesis is that aged individuals with HIV might be at higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or one of the AD-related dementias (ADRD). There are a number of mechanisms through which chronic HIV disease alone or in combination with antiretroviral therapy and other comorbidities (e.g., drug use, hepatitis C virus (HCV)) might be contributing to HAND in individuals over the age of 50 years, including (1) overlapping pathogenic mechanisms between HIV and aging (e.g., decreased proteostasis, DNA damage, chronic inflammation, epigenetics, vascular), which could lead to accelerated cellular aging and neurodegeneration and/or (2) by promoting pathways involved in AD/ADRD neuropathogenesis (e.g., triggering amyloid β, Tau, or α-synuclein accumulation).

Biomarkers can predict the onset of dementing illness, but also correlate with cognition in a dynamic way allowing us to follow treatment responses and determine brain recovery. Chronic HIV infection causes cognitive impairment in a subset of individuals suggesting “premature aging.” Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that are shed from all cells. They are important in normal cell-to-cell communication as they contain cellular proteins, mRNA transcripts, and miRNAs. Exosome cargo varies depending on the health of the cell and pathological state; specific proteins/mRNAs and/or miRNAs are present and may serve as biomarkers. Exosomes of variable cellular origin can be isolated from peripheral blood by various methods. Neuron-derived exosomes (NDEs) can be isolated using a precipitation/immunoaffinity approach using antibodies against neuronal cell adhesion molecule L1CAM and the contents queried for central nervous system (CNS) disorders including HIV-associated neurological disorders (HAND) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). As these studies are recent, numerous questions arise including which neuronal proteins are in NDEs and whether their contents differ in different CNS pathologies or with age. In addition, can the NDE cargo predict as well as diagnose cognitive impairment and could exosomal contents be used as therapeutic biomarkers, or theramarkers, of neuronal recovery from effective treatment? This mini-review will show some new data and review recent studies on NDE from individuals with HIV infection and AD. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are pathologies seen in a subset of individuals with chronic HIV infection. They belong to the spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases that result in death or dysfunction of neurons with similarities to Alzheimer disease (AD) but also distinctive differences (reviewed (Canet et al., Front Cell Neurosci 12: 307, 2018)). Both disorders are difficult to diagnose without neuropsychological testing and both need new biomarkers to judge progression as well as recovery with treatment. Both disorders involve neuroinflammation and several common targets. AD is associated with aging and HIV is thought to initiate premature aging. In HIV infection, amyloid beta (Aβ), which is deposited in “plaques” in AD, is soluble and its relevance to HIV-associated cognitive impairment is controversial (Achim et al., J Neuroimmune Pharmacol 4: 190–199, 2009; Rempel and Pulliam, AIDS 19: 127–135, 2005). Aβ deposition is required for AD pathological diagnosis, but is not necessarily causative (Barage and Sonawane, Neuropeptides 52: 1–18, 2015; Hardy and Selkoe, Science 297: 353–356, 2002; Morris et al., Acta Neuropathol Commun 2: 135, 2014). Neurofilament light (NF-L) is a surrogate marker in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for neurodegeneration (Abu-Rumeileh et al., Alzheimers Res Ther 10: 3, 2018; Mattsson et al., JAMA Neurol 74: 557–566, 2017) but continues to be a controversial biomarker for both HAND and AD (Gisslen et al., EBioMedicine 3: 135–140, 2016; Kovacs et al., Eur J Neurol 24:1326–e77, 2017; Norgren et al., Brain Res 987: 25–31, 2003; Rolstad et al., J Alzheimers Dis 45: 873–881, 2015; Yilmaz et al., Expert Rev Mol Diagn 17: 761–770, 2017). Blood biomarkers are needed to advance both HAND and AD fields, as blood draws are less costly than neuroimaging and are minimally invasive compared to lumbar punctures required for CSF acquisition. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoscale membranous vesicles shed from all cells including those of the central nervous system (CNS) and found in all biofluids; they are divided into exosomes (30–150 nm) originating from late endosomes/multivesicular bodies and microvesicles (150–1000 nm) produced through budding of the plasma membrane. Both types of vesicles are implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and may provide biomarkers (Bellingham et al., Front Physiol 3: 124, 2012). In this report, we call the vesicles exosomes, since they are the predominant vesicles in our preparations. They are involved in cell-to-cell communication in normal homeostasis and can be carriers of toxic proteins (Aβ, tau) (Sardar Sinha et al., Acta Neuropathol 136: 41–56, 2018) shed by cells as waste or actively secreted in a degenerative process (review Gupta and Pulliam, J Neuroinflammation 11: 68, 2014). The idea that exosomes originating from a specific cell can be recovered in the plasma using cellular surface markers of interest is intriguing. Neuron derived exosomes (NDEs) were first described in 2015 and isolated using antibodies against neural cell adhesion molecules NCAM or L1CAM, after total plasma exosome isolation (Fiandaca et al., Alzheimers Dement 11: 600–607 e1, 2015). Characterization of NDEs follows guidelines endorsed by the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles and includes Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) to determine EV concentration and average diameter; Western Blots for EV markers; ELISAs for neuronal proteins and transmission EM for visualization (Sun et al., AIDS 31: F9–F17, 2017; Tang et al., FASEB J 30: 3097–106, 2016). This innovative isolation of an exosome sub-population has generated interest in using NDE as biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases like AD, HAND, traumatic brain injury, posttraumatic stress disorder and more (reviews Agoston et al., Brain Inj 31: 1195–1203, 2017; Gupta and Pulliam, J Neuroinflammation 11: 68, 2014; Hu et al., Cell Death Dis 7: e2481, 2016; Karnati et al., J Neurotrauma, 2018; Osier et al., Mol Neurobiol, 2018). Several biomarkers from plasma NDEs were recently reported by the Pulliam lab to be elevated in general cognitive impairment (Sun et al., AIDS 31: F9–F17, 2017). We review our collective data here on HAND and AD and add to the characterization of plasma NDEs as exciting biomarkers of neurodegeneration.",182,30610738,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Alzheimer’s | Biomarker | Dementia | Exosomes | HIV | Neurons,16785,NIH,R21MH112483,National Institutes of Health,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,135,NA,NA

Loss of ARID1A compromises DNA damage repair. The induced DNA damage burden may increase reliance on PARP-dependent DNA repair of cancer cells to maintain genome integrity and render susceptibility to PARP inhibitor therapy. Experimental Design: Isogenic ARID1A-/- and wild-type cell lines were used for assessing DNA damage response, DNA compactness, and profiling global serine/threonine phosphoproteomic in vivo. A panel of inhibitors targeting DNA repair pathways was screened for a synergistic antitumor effect with irradiation in ARID1A-/- tumors. Results: ARID1A-deficient endometrial cells exhibit sustained levels in DNA damage response, a result further supported by in vivo phosphoproteomic analysis. Our results show that ARID1A is essential for establishing an open chromatin state upon DNA damage, a process required for recruitment of 53BP1 and RIF1, key mediators of nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) machinery, to DNA lesions. The inability of ARID1A-/- cells to mount NHEJ repair results in a partial cytotoxic response to radiation. Small-molecule compound screens revealed that PARP inhibitors act synergistically with radiation to potentiate cytotoxicity in ARID1A-/- cells. Combination treatment with low-dose radiation and olaparib greatly improved antitumor efficacy, resulting in long-term remission in mice bearing ARID1Adeficient tumors.

Current rehabilitation may not be sufficient to restore ability to walk in the community. Objective: To compare a multicomponent home-based physical therapy intervention (training) with an active control on ability to walk in the community. Design, Setting, and Participants: Parallel, 2-group randomized clinical trial conducted at 3 US clinical centers (Arcadia University, University of Connecticut Health Center, and University of Maryland, Baltimore). Randomization began on September 16, 2013, and ended on June 20, 2017; follow-up ended on October 17, 2017. Patients aged 60 years and older were enrolled after nonpathologic, minimal trauma hip fracture, if they were living in the community and walking without human assistance before the fracture, were assessed within 26 weeks of hospitalization, and were not able to walk during daily activities at the time of enrollment. A total of 210 participants were randomized and reassessed 16 and 40 weeks later. Interventions: The training intervention (active treatment) (n = 105) included aerobic, strength, balance, and functional training. The active control group (n = 105) received transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and active range-of-motion exercises. Both groups received 2 to 3 home visits from a physical therapist weekly for 16 weeks; nutritional counseling; and daily vitamin D (2000 IU), calcium (600 mg), and multivitamins. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome (community ambulation) was defined as walking 300 m or more in 6 minutes at 16 weeks after randomization. The study was designed to test a 1-sided hypothesis of superiority of training compared with active control. Results: Among 210 randomized participants (mean age, 80.8 years; 161 women [76.7%]), 197 (93.8%) completed the trial (187 [89.0%] by completing the 6-minute walk test at 16 weeks and 10 [4.8%] by adjudication of the primary outcome). Among these, 22 of 96 training participants (22.9%) and 18 of 101 active control participants (17.8%) (difference, 5.1% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to 16.3%]; 1-sided P =.19) became community ambulators. Seventeen training participants (16.2%) and 15 control participants (14.3%) had 1 or more reportable adverse events during the intervention period. The most common reportable adverse events reported were falls (training: 6 [5.7%], control: 4 [3.8%]), femur/hip fracture (2 in each group), pneumonia (training: 2, control: 0), urinary tract infection (training: 2, control: 0), dehydration (training: 0, control: 2), and dyspnea (training: 0, control: 2). Conclusions and Relevance: Among older adults with a hip fracture, a multicomponent home-based physical therapy intervention compared with an active control that included transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and active range-of-motion exercises did not result in a statistically significant improvement in the ability to walk 300 m or more in 6 minutes after 16 weeks.",64,31503309,Journal,ar,Article,100,19,19,NA,85291,NIH,P30 AG028747,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,140,NA,NA

Impairment of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation causes mitochondrial myopathy leading to decreased physical performance. Here, we report that haploinsufficiency of ADCK2, a member of the aarF domaincontaining mitochondrial protein kinase family, in human is associated with liver dysfunction and severe mitochondrial myopathy with lipid droplets in skeletal muscle. In order to better understand the etiology of this rare disorder, we generated a heterozygous Adck2 knockout mouse model to perform in vivo and cellular studies using integrated analysis of physiological and omics data (transcriptomics–metabolomics). The data showed that Adck2+/− mice exhibited impaired fatty acid oxidation, liver dysfunction, and mitochondrial myopathy in skeletal muscle resulting in lower physical performance. Significant decrease in Coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthesis was observed and supplementation with CoQ partially rescued the phenotype both in the human subject and mouse model. These results indicate that ADCK2 is involved in organismal fatty acid metabolism and in CoQ biosynthesis in skeletal muscle.

Biomarkers related to α-synuclein may be informative for PD diagnosis/progression. Objectives: To analyze α-synuclein in CSF in drug-naïve PD, healthy controls, and prodromal PD in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. Methods: Over up to 36-month follow-up, CSF total α-synuclein and its association with MDS-UPDRS motor scores, cognitive assessments, and dopamine transporter imaging were assessed. Results: The inception cohort included PD (n = 376; age [mean {standard deviation} years]: 61.7 [9.62]), healthy controls (n = 173; age, 60.9 [11.3]), hyposmics (n = 16; age, 68.3 [6.15]), and idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (n = 32; age, 69.3 [4.83]). Baseline CSF α-synuclein was lower in manifest and prodromal PD versus healthy controls. Longitudinal α-synuclein decreased significantly in PD at 24 and 36 months, did not change in prodromal PD over 12 months, and trended toward an increase in healthy controls. The decrease in PD was not shown when CSF samples with high hemoglobin concentration were removed from the analysis. CSF α-synuclein changes did not correlate with longitudinal MDS-UPDRS motor scores or dopamine transporter scan. Conclusions: CSF α-synuclein decreases early in the disease, preceding motor PD. CSF α-synuclein does not correlate with progression and therefore does not reflect ongoing dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Decreased CSF α-synuclein may be an indirect index of changes in the balance between α-synuclein secretion, solubility, or aggregation in the brain, reflecting its overall turnover.

The ELAV like RNA-binding protein 1 (ELAVL1, also called HuR) regulates stability and translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and many aspects of mucosal physiology. We studied the posttranscriptional mechanisms by which HuR regulates Paneth cell function. Methods: Intestinal mucosal tissues were collected from mice with intestinal epithelium (IE)-specific disruption of HuR (IE-HuR–/–), HuRfl/fl-Cre– mice (controls), and patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry. Paneth cell functions were determined by lysozyme-immunostaining assays. We isolated primary enterocytes from IE-HuR–/– and control mice and derived intestinal organoids. HuR and the chaperone CNPY3 were overexpressed from transgenes in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) or knocked down with small interfering RNAs. We performed RNA pulldown assays to investigate interactions between HuR and its target mRNAs. Results: Intestinal tissues from IE-HuR–/– mice had reduced numbers of Paneth cells, and Paneth cells had fewer lysozyme granules per cell, compared with tissues from control mice, but there were no effects on Goblet cells or enterocytes. Intestinal mucosa from patients with inflammatory bowel diseases had reduced levels of HuR and fewer Paneth cells. IE-HuR–/– mice did not have the apical distribution of TLR2 in the intestinal mucosa as observed in control mice. IECs from IE-HuR–/– mice expressed lower levels of CNPY3. Intestinal organoids from IE-HuR–/– mice were smaller and contained fewer buds compared with those generated from controls, and had fewer lysozyme-positive cells. In IECs, knockdown of HuR decreased levels of the autophagy proteins LC3-I and LC3-II, compared with control cells, and prevented rapamycin-induced autophagy. We found HuR to interact directly with the Cnpy3 mRNA coding region and increase levels of CNPY3 by increasing the stability and translation of Cnpy3 mRNA. CNPY3 bound TLR2, and cells with knockdown of CNPY3 or HuR lost membrane localization of TLR2, but increased cytoplasmic levels of TLR2.

In multivariable logistic regression models, diabetes was associated with higher risk (OR = 3.24, 95% CI = 1.38–7.59), whereas higher physical activity (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.80–0.99) and gait speed (OR = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.005–0.27) with lower risk of NGA. Prevalence of NGA was associated with difficulty in at least 1 activity of daily living, adjusting for confounders (OR = 2.90, 95% CI = 1.11–7.58). After adjusting for gait speed, this association was attenuated to non-significance (OR = 2.13, 95% CI = 0.71–6.37). Conclusions: In our sample of community-dwelling older adults without neurological diseases, NGA, detected with a standardized neurological exam, part of usual physicians' training, were common. The relationships with diabetes and reduced physical activity might suggest vascular dysfunction as an underlying contributor to NGA. These results, if confirmed by longitudinal studies, which should also disentangle the relationship between NGA, gait speed and disability, might add information for preventing and managing mobility disability.",7,31288087,Journal,ar,Article,100,10,10,Cardiovascular | Diabetes | Disability | Gait speed | Walking,29003,NIH,N01-AG-6-2101,National Institutes of Health,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,154,110652,S0531556519301925

We have previously shown that (-)-phenserine (Phen), an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor originally designed and tested in clinical phase III trials for Alzheimer’s disease, can reduce neurodegeneration after TBI and reduce cognitive impairments induced by mild TBI. In this study, we used a mouse model of moderate to severe TBI by controlled cortical impact to assess the effects of Phen on post-trauma histochemical and behavioral changes. Animals were treated with Phen (2.5 mg/kg, IP, BID) for 5 days started on the day of injury and the effects were evaluated by behavioral and histological examinations at 1 and 2 weeks after injury. Phen significantly attenuated TBI-induced contusion volume, enlargement of the lateral ventricle, and behavioral impairments in motor asymmetry, sensorimotor functions, motor coordination, and balance functions. The morphology of microglia was shifted to an active from a resting form after TBI, and Phen dramatically reduced the ratio of activated to resting microglia, suggesting that Phen also mitigates neuroinflammation after TBI. While Phen has potent anti-acetylcholinesterase activity, its (+) isomer Posiphen shares many neuroprotective properties but is almost completely devoid of anti-acetylcholinesterase activity. We evaluated Posiphen at a similar dose to Phen and found similar mitigation in lateral ventricular size increase, motor asymmetry, motor coordination, and balance function, suggesting the improvement of these histological and behavioral tests by Phen treatment occur via pathways other than anti-acetylcholinesterase inhibition. However, the reduction of lesion size and improvement of sensorimotor function by Posiphen were much smaller than with equivalent doses of Phen. Taken together, these results show that post-injury treatment with Phen over 5 days significantly ameliorates severity of TBI.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study, United States. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling men and women, aged 70 to 81 years in 1998 to 1999 (first follow-up, present study's baseline; n = 2154). MEASUREMENTS: At first follow-up, dietary intake over the preceding year was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire. Indicators of diet quality include the Healthy Eating Index (categorized as poor, medium, and good), energy intake, and protein intake (a priori adjusted for energy intake using the nutrient residual model). Frailty status was determined using Fried's five-component frailty phenotype and categorized into “robust” (0 components present), “pre-frailty” (1 - 2 components present), or “frail” (3-5 components present). Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to examine associations of the diet quality indicators with 4-year incidence of (1) frailty and (2) pre-frailty or frailty. Competing risk analysis was used to examine associations with frailty by accounting for competing risks of death. RESULTS: During the 4-year follow-up, 277 of the 2154 participants, robust or pre-frail at baseline, developed frailty, and 629 of the 1020 participants, robust at baseline, developed pre-frailty or frailty. Among the robust and pre-frail, after adjustment for confounders including energy intake, those consuming poor- and medium-quality diets had a higher frailty incidence than those consuming good-quality diets (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.92 [95% confidence interval {CI} = 1.17-3.17] and HR = 1.40 [95% CI = 0.99-1.98], respectively). No associations for energy or protein intake were observed. Competing risk analyses yielded similar results.

But the mechanism for continuous fork progression after encountering roadblocks is entangled with translesion synthesis, replication fork reversal and recombination repair. The recently determined structure of the bacteriophage T7 replisome offers the first glimpse of how helicase, primase, leading-and lagging-strand DNA polymerases are organized around a DNA replication fork. The tightly coupled leading-strand polymerase and lagging-strand helicase provides a scaffold to consolidate data accumulated over the past five decades and offers a fresh perspective on how the replisome may skip lesions and complete discontinuous DNA synthesis.

Objective: To evaluate the association of midlife HI with brain volume trajectories in later life (≥65 years of age). Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study used data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging to evaluate hearing from November 5, 1990, to October 3, 1994, and late-life volume change from July 10, 2008, to January 29, 2015, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (mean follow-up time, 19.3 years).

Excluded were those with baseline cognitive impairment, stroke, head injuries, Parkinson disease, and bipolar disorder. Exposures: Hearing as measured with pure tone audiometry in each ear from November 5, 1990, to October 3, 1994, and late-life temporal lobe volume change measured by MRI. Main Outcomes and Measures: Linear mixed-effects models with random intercepts were used to examine the association of midlife hearing (pure tone average of 0.5-4 kHz tones in the better ear and each ear separately) with longitudinal late-life MRI-based measures of temporal lobe structures (hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyri) in the left and right hemispheres, in addition to global and lobar regions, adjusting for baseline demographic characteristics (age, sex, subsequent cognitive impairment status, and educational level) and intracranial volume.

Yet potential combinatory or synergistic effects among several modulatory SNPs for PD risk or AAO remain largely underexplored. Objectives: The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is functionally impaired in PD. Here we explored whether SNPs in the mTOR pathway, alone or by epistatic interaction with known susceptibility factors, can modulate PD risk and AAO. Methods: Based on functional relevance, we selected a total of 64 SNPs mapping to a total of 57 genes from the mTOR pathway and genotyped a discovery series cohort encompassing 898 PD patients and 921 controls. As a replication series, we screened 4170 PD and 3014 controls available from the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium. Results: In the discovery series cohort, we found a 4-loci interaction involving STK11 rs8111699, FCHSD1 rs456998, GSK3B rs1732170, and SNCA rs356219, which was associated with an increased risk of PD (odds ratio = 2.59, P <.001). In addition, we also found a 3-loci epistatic combination of RPTOR rs11868112 and RPS6KA2 rs6456121 with SNCA rs356219, which was associated (odds ratio = 2.89; P <.0001) with differential AAO. The latter was further validated (odds ratio = 1.56; P = 0.046-0.047) in the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium cohort.

Nitration/oxidation of αSyn leads to dityrosine crosslinking and aggregation. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an oxidant-generating enzyme implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. In the present work we have examined the impact of MPO in PD through analysis of postmortem PD brain and in a novel animal model in which we crossed a transgenic mouse expressing the human MPO (hMPO) gene to a mouse expressing human αSyn-A53T mutant (A53T) (hMPO-A53T). Surprisingly, our results show that in PD substantia nigra, the hMPO gene is expressed in neurons containing aggregates of nitrated αSyn as well as MPO-generated HOCl-modified epitopes. In our hMPO-A53T mouse model, we also saw hMPO expression in neurons but not mouse MPO. In the mouse model, hMPO was expressed in neurons colocalizing with nitrated αSyn, carbamylated lysine, nitrotyrosine, as well as HOCl-modified epitopes/proteins. RNAscope in situ hybridization confirmed hMPO mRNA expression in neurons. Interestingly, the hMPO protein expressed in hMPO-A53T brain is primarily the precursor proMPO, which enters the secretory pathway potentially resulting in interneuronal transmission of MPO and oxidative species. Importantly, the hMPO-A53T mouse model, when compared to the A53T model, exhibited significant exacerbation of motor impairment on rotating rods, balance beams, and wire hang tests. Further, hMPO expression in the A53T model resulted in earlier onset of end stage paralysis. Interestingly, there was a high concentration of αSyn aggregates in the stratum lacunosum moleculare of hippocampal CA2 region, which has been associated in humans with accumulation of αSyn pathology and neural atrophy in dementia with Lewy bodies. This accumulation of αSyn aggregates in CA2 was associated with markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response with expression of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), MPO, and cleaved caspase-3.

Topics addressed included reliable and clinically feasible measures of function and key domains of health (eg, musculoskeletal, cognitive, and sensory) that are most strongly associated with patients' perceptions of well-being, independence, and quality of life across a wide array of diseases and interventions. The workshop also focused on the importance of function in medical decision making to inform communications between specialty physicians and patients about prognosis and goals of care. Workshop participants called for more research on the role of function as a predictor of an intervention's effectiveness and an important treatment outcome.

This investigation examined both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and LLD. Methods: Data from 603 men and women from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging were analyzed, of whom 167 provided data from a follow-up visit. Muscle bioenergetics was measured by postexercise recovery rate of phosphocreatine (PCr) using phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale. Results: There was no cross-sectional association between baseline depression status and either the PCr recovery rate constant (kPCr; t = –0.553, df = 542; p = 0.580) or mitochondrial capacity largely independent of exercise intensity (adenosine triphosphate maximum [ATPmax]; t = 0.804, df = 553; p = 0.422). Covariate-adjusted Firth logistic regression models however showed that greater decreases in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function from baseline to follow-up were associated with higher odds of clinically significant depressive symptoms (CES-D ≥16) at follow-up (ΔATPmax: odds ratio = 2.63, χ2 = 5.62, df =1; p = 0.018; ΔkPCr: odds ratio = 2.32, χ2 = 5.79, df =1; p = 0.016).

The risk of PD increases greatly in people over the age of 65, a period of life in which chronic inflammation is common in many organ systems including the gut. Here we report that chronic mild focal intestinal inflammation accelerates the age of disease onset in α-synuclein mutant PD mice. Wild-type and PD mice treated with 0.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in their drinking water for 12 weeks beginning at 3 months of age exhibited histological and biochemical features of mild gut inflammation. The age of onset of motor dysfunction, evaluated using a rotarod test, gait analysis, and grip strength measurements, was significantly earlier in DSS-treated PD mice compared to control PD mice. Levels of the dopaminergic neuron marker tyrosine hydroxylase in the striatum and numbers of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra were reduced in PD mice with gut inflammation. Levels of total and phosphorylated α-synuclein were elevated in enteric and brain neurons in DSS-treated PD mice, suggesting that mild gut inflammation accelerates α-synuclein pathology. Markers of inflammation in the colon and brain, but not in the blood, were elevated in DSS-treated PD mice, consistent with retrograde transneuronal propagation of α-synuclein pathology and neuroinflammation from the gut to the brain.

Methods: We studied 962 individuals aged ≥65 (mean age 74.4; female 55.5%) with a mean follow-up of 95.7 months, enrolled in the InCHIANTI study. The relationship between liver fibrosis scores and mortality and disability was assessed through Cox and log-binomial regressions. Results: NFS and FIB-4 were associated with higher overall (aHR ranging 1.38–1.78 for intermediate risk of fibrosis and 1.60–2.02 for high risk) and cardiovascular (aHR ranging 1.76–2.90 for intermediate and 2.22–2.42 for high risk) mortality. AST/ALT and BARD were only associated with overall mortality. Only NFS and FIB-4 high risk classes were associated with incident disability (aRR ranging 1.93–2.76).

We examined blood DNA methylation in relation to incident CHD across multiple prospective cohorts. METHODS: Nine population-based cohorts from the United States and Europe profiled epigenome-wide blood leukocyte DNA methylation using the Illumina Infinium 450k microarray, and prospectively ascertained CHD events including coronary insufficiency/unstable angina, recognized myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, and coronary death.

Since DNAm has not been widely studied among non-European populations, we examined the association between DNAm and chronological age in AAs and whites, and the association between race, poverty, sex, and epigenetic age acceleration. Results: We measured genome-wide DNA methylation (866,836 CpGs) using the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip in blood DNA extracted from 487 middle-aged AA (N = 244) and white (N = 243), men (N = 248), and women (N = 239).

Linear mixed effects models examined longitudinal associations adjusting for year, age, sex, race, education, smoking, depression, diabetes, study site, as well as interaction terms between the vision parameters and years in study, between baseline age and years in study, and quadratic terms of baseline age and years in study. Discrete Cox regression models examined the risk of incident cognitive impairment. Results: Analyses included 2,444 participants (mean age = 74). Visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and stereo acuity impairments were not associated with statistically significant changes in annual digit symbol test scores over 7 years of follow-up, as compared to those without these impairments. However, visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and stereo acuity impairments were associated with greater declines in annual 3MS scores over 9 years. Participants with impaired visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and stereo acuity had a greater risk of incident cognitive impairment. Conclusions: Our results suggest that visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and stereo acuity impairments may be risk factors for cognitive decline.",97,30358809,Journal,ar,Article,100,8,8,Brain aging | Cognition | Cognitive aging | Visual impairment,29559,NIH,NEI EY01765,National Institutes of Health,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,180,NA,NA

Survival curves provide evidence of altered aging processes but are uninformative on what lead to that increase in life span. Longitudinal assessments of health and function during intervention studies could help in the identification of predictive biomarkers for health and survival. Comparable biomarkers of healthspan are necessary to effectively translate interventions into human clinical trials. Gait speed is a well-established predictive biomarker of healthspan in humans for risk of disability, health outcomes and mortality, and is relatively simple to assess noninvasively in rodents. In this study, we assessed and compared gait speed in males from two species (mice and humans), from young adulthood to advanced old age. Although gait speed decreases nonlinearly with age in both species, the underlying drivers of this change in gait speed were different, with humans exhibiting a shortened step length, and mice displaying a decrease in cadence.

High-dose Meth induces degeneration of dopaminergic neurons through p53-mediated apoptosis. A recent study indicated that treatment with the p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-alpha (PFT-α), antagonized Meth-mediated behavioral deficits in mice. The mechanisms underpinning the protective action of PFT-α against Meth have not been identified, and hence, their investigation is the focus of this study. Primary dopaminergic neuronal cultures were prepared from rat embryonic ventral mesencephalic tissue. High-dose Meth challenge reduced tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity and increased terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dNTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) labeling. PFT-α significantly antagonized these responses. PFT-α also reduced Meth-activated translocation of p53 to the nucleus, an initial step before transcription. Previous studies have indicated that p53 can also activate cell death through transcription-independent pathways. We found that PFT-α attenuated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressor thapsigargin (Tg)-mediated loss of dopaminergic neurons. ER stress was further monitored through the release of Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) from SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing GLuc-based Secreted ER Calcium-Modulated Protein (GLuc-SERCaMP). Meth or Tg significantly increased GLuc release in to the media, with PFT-α significantly reducing GLuc release. Additionally, PFT-α significantly attenuated Meth-induced CHOP expression.

Key to this process is the cells’ ability to stabilize and restart stalled replication forks. Here, we show that the EXD2 nuclease is essential to this process. EXD2 recruitment to stressed forks suppresses their degradation by restraining excessive fork regression. Accordingly, EXD2 deficiency leads to fork collapse, hypersensitivity to replication inhibitors, and genomic instability. Impeding fork regression by inactivation of SMARCAL1 or removal of RECQ1’s inhibition in EXD2−/− cells restores efficient fork restart and genome stability. Moreover, purified EXD2 efficiently processes substrates mimicking regressed forks. Thus, this work identifies a mechanism underpinned by EXD2’s nuclease activity, by which cells balance fork regression with fork restoration to maintain genome stability. Interestingly, from a clinical perspective, we discover that EXD2’s depletion is synthetic lethal with mutations in BRCA1/2, implying a non-redundant role in replication fork protection. Nieminuszczy et al. identify a key function of the EXD2 nuclease in DNA replication and alternative end-joining.

The greater systolic ankle than brachial blood pressure, a normal ABI implies, is partially attributed to lower central than peripheral arterial stiffness. Hence, we examined the hypothesis that the age-associated decline in ABI is associated with central arterial stiffening with aging, assessed by pulse wave velocity. Methods and Results: We analyzed longitudinal data from 974 participants aged 27 to 95 years from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging who were free of clinically significant cardiovascular disease. Participants had an average of 4 visits with a 6.8-year average follow-up time. Linear mixed-effects models showed that the average ABI decline beyond the age of 70 years was 0.03 per decade. In multiple regression analysis, the ABI rate of change was inversely associated with initial age (standardized β=−0.0711, P=0.0282), independent of peripheral disease factors and baseline ABI. After adjustment, the pulse wave velocity rate of change was inversely associated with ABI rate of change (standardized β=−0.0993, P=0.0040), rendering the association of the latter with initial age nonsignificant (standardized β=−0.0265, P=0.5418). Conclusions: A modest longitudinal decline in ABI beyond the age of 70 years was shown to be independent of traditional risk factors for peripheral arterial disease but was accounted for by an increase in pulse wave velocity.

This method detects full-length circRNA sequences by performing reverse transcription (RT) in the absence of RNase H activity, followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of full-length circRNAs using a forward primer spanning the backsplice junction sequence and a reverse primer exactly upstream of the forward primer. By sequencing the PCR products, circRNA splice variants bearing the same backsplice junctions, which were otherwise only predicted computationally, could be experimentally validated. The splice variants were further predicted to associate with different subsets of target RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs, supporting the notion that different circRNA splice variants can have different biological impacts. In sum, the circRNA-RCA method allows the accurate identification of full-length circRNA sequences, offering unique insight into their individual function.",29,31426285,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Alternative splicing | Backsplice sequence | CircRNAs | Divergent primers | RNase R | RT-PCR | Splice variants,25879,NIH,SB/S2/RJN-099/2017,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,193,3988,NA

Cigarette smoking is one such lifestyle factor. Across five ancestries, we performed a genome-wide gene-smoking interaction study of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and pulse pressure (PP) in 129 913 individuals in stage 1 and follow-up analysis in 480 178 additional individuals in stage 2. We report here 136 loci significantly associated with MAP and/or PP. Of these, 61 were previously published through main-effect analysis of BP traits, 37 were recently reported by us for systolic BP and/or diastolic BP through gene-smoking interaction analysis and 38 were newly identified (P < 5 × 10-8, false discovery rate < 0.05). We also identified nine new signals near known loci. Of the 136 loci, 8 showed significant interaction with smoking status. They include CSMD1 previously reported for insulin resistance and BP in the spontaneously hypertensive rats. Many of the 38 new loci show biologic plausibility for a role in BP regulation.

Methods We evaluated the association between 31 risk variants and variables measuring disease progression. A total of 23,423 visits by 4,307 patients of European ancestry from 13 longitudinal cohorts in Europe, North America, and Australia were analyzed. Results We confirmed the importance of GBA on phenotypes. GBA variants were associated with the development of daytime sleepiness (p.N370S: hazard ratio [HR] 3.28 [1.69–6.34]) and possible REM sleep behavior (p.T408M: odds ratio 6.48 [2.04–20.60]).

We hypothesized that structural and physiologic MR imaging findings of early cerebrovascular disease can be measured in middle-aged subjects in tissue adjacent to WM lesions, termed “penumbra.” MATERIALS AND METHODS: WM lesions were defined using automated segmentation in 463 subjects, 43–56 years of age, from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) longitudinal observational cohort study. We described 0- to 2-mm and 2- to 4-mm-thick spatially defined penumbral WM tissue ROIs as rings surrounding WM lesions. The remaining WM was defined as distant normal-appearing WM. Mean signal intensities were measured for FLAIR, T1-, and T2-weighted images, and from fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, CBF, and vascular reactivity maps. Group comparisons were made using Kruskal-Wallis and pair-wise t tests. RESULTS: Lesion volumes averaged 0.738 0.842 cm3 (range, 0.005–7.27 cm3). Mean signal intensity for FLAIR, T2, and mean diffusivity was increased, while T1, fractional anisotropy, and CBF were decreased in white matter lesions versus distant normal-appearing WM, with penumbral tissues showing graded intermediate values (corrected P .001 for all group/parameter comparisons). Vascular reactivity was significantly elevated in white matter lesions and penumbral tissue compared with distant normal-appearing white matter (corrected P .001). CONCLUSIONS: Even in relatively healthy 43- to 56-year-old subjects with small white matter lesion burden, structural and functional MR imaging in penumbral tissue reveals significant signal abnormalities versus white matter lesions and other normal WM.

Objective: The aim of this study was to assess whether folate and/or vitamin B-12 intake are asssociated with genome-wide changes in DNA methylation in leukocytes. Methods: A large-scale epigenome-wide association study of folate and vitamin B-12 intake was performed on DNA from 5841 participants from 10 cohorts using Illumina 450k arrays. Folate and vitamin B-12 intakes were calculated from food-frequency questionnaires (FFQs).

A meta-analysis was performed to identify significant differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs), and a pathway analysis was performed on the DMR annotated genes. Results: The categorical model resulted in 6 DMPs, which are all negatively associated with folate intake, annotated to FAM64A, WRAP73, FRMD8, CUX1, and LCN8 genes, which have a role in cellular processes including centrosome localization, cell proliferation, and tumorigenesis. Regional analysis showed 74 folate-associated DMRs, of which 73 were negatively associated with folate intake. The most significant folate-associated DMR was a 400-base pair (bp) spanning region annotated to the LGALS3BP gene. In the categorical model, vitamin B-12 intake was associated with 29 DMRs annotated to 48 genes, of which the most significant was a 1100-bp spanning region annotated to the calcium-binding tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated gene (CABYR). Vitamin B-12 intake was not associated with DMPs. Conclusions: We identified novel epigenetic loci that are associated with folate and vitamin B-12 intake.

As breakfast timing and skipping are not routinely measured in large cohort studies, alternative approaches include analyses of correlated traits.

Methods: We leveraged the statistical power of the UK Biobank (n = 193,860) to identify genetic variants related to breakfast cereal skipping as a proxy-phenotype for breakfast skipping and applied several in silico approaches to investigate mechanistic functions and links to traits/diseases. Next, we attempted validation of our approach in smaller breakfast skipping GWAS from the TwinUK (n = 2,006) and the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium (n = 11,963). Results: In the UK Biobank, we identified 6 independent GWAS variants, including those implicated for caffeine (ARID3B/CYP1A1), carbohydrate metabolism (FGF21), schizophrenia (ZNF804A), and encoding enzymes important for N6-methyladenosine RNA transmethylation (METTL4, YWHAB, and YTHDF3), which regulates the pace of the circadian clock. Expression of identified genes was enriched in the cerebellum. Genome-wide correlation analyses indicated positive correlations with anthropometric traits. Through Mendelian randomization (MR), we observed causal links between genetically determined breakfast skipping and higher body mass index, more depressive symptoms, and smoking. In bidirectional MR, we demonstrated a causal link between being an evening person and skipping breakfast, but not vice versa.

Methods: We investigated the binding of apoE, a peptide corresponding to its low-density lipoprotein receptor binding domain (amino acids 133–152; ApoEp), and modified ApoEp to amyloid precursor protein (APP) and their effects on amyloid-β (Aβ) production in cultured cells. Having discovered a peptide (6KApoEp) that blocks the interaction of apoE with N-terminal APP, we investigated the effects of this peptide and ApoEp on AD-like pathology and behavioral impairment in 3XTg-AD and 5XFAD transgenic mice. Results: ApoE and ApoEp, but not truncated apoE lacking the low-density lipoprotein receptor binding domain, physically interacted with N-terminal APP and thereby mediated Aβ production. Interestingly, the addition of 6 lysine residues to the N-terminus of ApoEp (6KApoEp) directly inhibited apoE binding to N-terminal APP and markedly limited apoE- and ApoEp-mediated Aβ generation, presumably through decreasing APP cellular membrane trafficking and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. Moreover, while promoting apoE interaction with APP by ApoEp exacerbated Aβ and tau brain pathologies in 3XTg-AD mice, disrupting this interaction by 6KApoEp ameliorated cerebral Aβ and tau pathologies, neuronal apoptosis, synaptic loss, and hippocampal-dependent learning and memory impairment in 5XFAD mice without altering cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein receptor, and apoE expression levels.

Method: Learning was defined by the sum of free recall over three test trials. Retention was defined in two ways: by delayed free recall (DFR) and by savings; DFR adjusted for learning. The performances of 217 incident AD cases from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) were aligned based on the time that AD was first diagnosed. The predementia phase of learning and retention decline was assessed using change point models in which cognitive trajectories are described by a series of linear components with knots delineating times of accelerating decline. Results: Trajectories for both learning and DFR had two change points: the first at 6.58 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 6.56, 6.60) to 7.29 (95% CI: 6.13, 8.46) years before diagnosis followed by gradual decline over the next 4 years, and a second acceleration of decline 1.89 (0.56, 3.24) to 2.93 (95% CI: 1.56, 4.30) years before diagnosis.

The current study examined associations between systemic inflammation and cognitive performance among African-Americans and Whites urban adults. Methods: Participants were selected from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study (2004–2013, baseline age: 30–64 y, mean ± SD follow-up time of 4.64 ± 0.93 y, N = 189–222, k = 1.5–1.7 observations/participant). Cytokines known to be positively linked to AD incidence among others were tested against cross-sectional and longitudinal cognitive function, stratifying by age group (≤50 y vs. >50 y), sex and race.

Results: Among key findings, IL1β was positively associated with a faster rate of decline on a test of executive functioning, among older adults (age >50 y, γ11 = +2.49 ± 0.89, p = 0.005), while in the total population, IL-6 was linked to a faster decline on a test of verbal memory (γ11 = −0.011 ± 0.004, p = 0.009). Among younger participants, IL-18 was linked to a poorer performance on a test of attention at baseline (age ≤50 y, γ01 = −0.007 ± 0.0025, p = 0.004) though a slower rate of decline with higher IL-18 was detected for a test of psychomotor speed in older adults (age >50 y, γ11 = +0.0010 ± 0.0004, p = 0.008). Finally, among Whites, unlike among African-Americans, IL-6 was associated with a better baseline performance on two tests of verbal and working memory.

Nevertheless, the definition of disability in terms of activities of daily living may not resemble the pattern of functional impairment occurring during aging. The aim of this study was to examine the discriminative capacity of the FP toward the identification of patterns of disabilities in an extended list of tasks, identified among community-dwelling older people. Design: Longitudinal cohort study. Setting and participants: We included 997 persons age 65 years and older selected from the Invecchiare in Chianti (InCHIANTI) Study population. Measures: Using latent class analysis, we assessed the pattern of 3-year changes in 24 functional tasks. Then, we calculated the discriminative capacity of the FP for each pattern of disability. Analyses were stratified by sex. Results: In both men and women, we recognized 3 classes: stable function; disability in complex tasks; and global functional disability. Among women, ability of FP to identify persons in global functional disability showed sensitivity = 0.42, specificity = 0.98, positive and negative predictive values 0.75 and 0.91; the corresponding values for prediction of disability in complex tasks were 0.13, 0.98, 0.68, and 0.75. Similar results were obtained among men. Conclusions/Implications: Over 3 years, older people of the InCHIANTI population remained largely functional stable, some persons developed deficiency in complex tasks, and a minority developed global functional disability. Trying to predict these 3 patterns may be useful for the care of older people in order to promote individualized interventions to reduce the burden of disabilities and their consequences.

Recently, biased ligands possessing different efficacies in activating the G protein- versus the β-arrestin-dependent signals downstream of a single GPCR have emerged, which can be used to selectively modulate GPCR signal transduction in such a way that desirable signals are enhanced to produce therapeutic effects while undesirable signals of the same GPCR are suppressed to avoid side effects. In the present study, we evaluated agonist bias for compounds developed along a drug discovery project of β2-adrenoceptor agonists. About 150 compounds, including derivatives of fenoterol, 2-amino-1-phenylethanol and 2-amino-2-phenylethanol, were obtained or synthesized, and initially screened for their β-adrenoceptor-mediated activities in the guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle relaxation assay or the cardiomyocyte contractility assay. Nineteen bioactive compounds were further assessed using both the HTRF cAMP assay and the PathHunter β-arrestin assay. Their concentration-response data in stimulating cAMP synthesis and β-arrestin recruitment were applied to the Black–Leff operational model for ligand bias quantitation. As a result, three compounds (L-2, L-4, and L-12) with the core structure of 5-(1-amino-2-hydroxyethyl)-8-hydroxyquinolin-2(1H)-one were identified as a new series of β-arrestin-biased β2-adrenoceptor agonists, whereas salmeterol was found to be Gs-biased.

Pharmacological inhibition of FGFR1, Erk phosphorylation, and monocarboxylic acid transporters prevents Klotho-induced lactate release from astrocytes. Taken together, these data suggest Klotho is a potential new player in the metabolic coupling between neurons and astrocytes.

Analysis of individual participant data (IPD) may help clarify this association. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a systematic review and IPD meta-analysis of prospective studies on the association between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and depressive symptoms. We will identify studies through a systematic search of the literature in the Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases from inception to April 2019 and from the Thyroid Studies Collaboration. We will ask corresponding authors of studies that meet our inclusion criteria to collaborate by providing IPD. Our primary outcome will be depressive symptoms at the first available individual follow-up, measured on a validated scale. We will convert all the scores to the Beck Depression Inventory scale. For each cohort, we will estimate the mean difference of depressive symptoms between participants with subclinical hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism and control adjusted for depressive symptoms at baseline. Furthermore, we will adjust our multivariable linear regression analyses for age, sex, education and income. We will pool the effect estimates of all studies in a random-effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity will be assessed by I2. Our secondary outcomes will be depressive symptoms at a specific follow-up time, at the last available individual follow-up and incidence of depression at the first, last and at a specific follow-up time. For the binary outcome of incident depression, we will use a logistic regression model. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Formal ethical approval is not required as primary data will not be collected. Our findings will have considerable implications for patient care. We will seek to publish this systematic review and IPD meta-analysis in a high-impact clinical journal.

To date, curcumin (CUR), a natural polyphenol and primary component of turmeric, shows putative therapeutic properties such as reducing the incidence of obesity-related diseases in mice. However, the mechanism by which CUR regulates insulin levels remains unclear. Methods: This study investigates how dietary CUR improves insulin clearance and maintains a proper range of circulating insulin level in the diet-induced obesity (DIO) mouse model. Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed a control, a high fat/high sugar (HFS) or a HFS diet containing 0.4% (w/w) curcumin (HFS + CUR) (N = 16 per group) for 16 weeks. Results: Mice given HFS + CUR had reduced body weight and fat accumulation in the liver and had lower blood insulin levels under fasting conditions compared to mice on HFS alone, resulting from significantly improved insulin clearance via upregulation of hepatic insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). We also observed restoration of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), especially class Ia catalytic subunits, p110α and p110β, and class Ib regulatory subunit, p101, and phosphorylated protein kinase B (AKT) expression levels in liver on HFS + CUR diet. Additionally, HFS + CUR fed mice had significantly smaller islets of Langerhans and increased glucagon contents compared to HFS fed mice, indicating less secretion of insulin in pancreas. The expression of thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), a pro-oxidant and pro-apoptotic protein, was significantly elevated in mouse and human islets cultured under HFS mimicking conditions, which was mitigated by CUR treatment. Conclusions: CUR supplementation in obese subjects may alleviate the burden imposed by HFS diets. Our data indicate administration of dietary CUR reinstates PI3K, AKT and IDE levels in obese mice. Additionally, CUR treatment preserves islet integrity by downregulation of TXNIP transcription levels. Therefore, dietary CUR may have the potential to serve as a novel therapeutic agent to address the underlying links of obesity and T2DM.",30,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Curcumin | Hepatic insulin signaling pathway | Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) | Insulin sensitivity | Islet integrity | Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K),15300154824,NIH,1UC4DK098085,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,213,48,NA

A key player in this process is the microtubule-severing enzyme spastin that localizes at the midbody where its activity is crucial to cut microtubules and culminate the cytokinesis. Recently, we demonstrated that HIPK2, a multifunctional kinase involved in several cellular pathways, contributes to abscission and prevents tetraploidization. Here, we show that HIPK2 binds and phosphorylates spastin at serine 268. During cytokinesis, the midbody-localized spastin is phosphorylated at S268 in HIPK2-proficient cells. In contrast, no spastin is detectable at the midbody in HIPK2-depleted cells. The non-phosphorylatable spastin-S268A mutant does not localize at the midbody and cannot rescue HIPK2-depleted cells from abscission defects. In contrast, the phosphomimetic spastin-S268D mutant localizes at the midbody and restores successful abscission in the HIPK2-depleted cells. These results show that spastin is a novel target of HIPK2 and that HIPK2-mediated phosphorylation of spastin contributes to its midbody localization for successful abscission.",20,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,10,10,Abscission | HIPK2 | Midbody | Phosphorylation | Spastin,21100978391,FIRC,GGP16072,Fondazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,219,684,NA

Identifying metabolic risk factors that interact with the genetic risk of NAFLD is important for reducing disease burden. We tested whether serum glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index (BMI), and waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI interact with genetic variants in or near the patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3) gene, the glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR) gene, the neurocan/transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (NCAN/TM6SF2) gene, and the lysophospholipase-like 1 (LYPLAL1) gene to exacerbate hepatic steatosis, estimated by liver attenuation. We performed association analyses in 10 population-based cohorts separately and then meta-analyzed results in up to 14,751 individuals (11,870 of European ancestry and 2,881 of African ancestry). We found that PNPLA3-rs738409 significantly interacted with insulin, insulin resistance, BMI, glucose, and TG to increase hepatic steatosis in nondiabetic individuals carrying the G allele. Additionally, GCKR-rs780094 significantly interacted with insulin, insulin resistance, and TG. Conditional analyses using the two largest European ancestry cohorts in the study showed that insulin levels accounted for most of the interaction of PNPLA3-rs738409 with BMI, glucose, and TG in nondiabetic individuals. Insulin, PNPLA3-rs738409, and their interaction accounted for at least 8% of the variance in hepatic steatosis in these two cohorts. Conclusion: Insulin resistance, either directly or through the resultant elevated insulin levels, more than other metabolic traits, appears to amplify the PNPLA3-rs738409-G genetic risk for hepatic steatosis.

Effect of including multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities into ACA framework in detecting white-to-white or gray-to-white connections is yet to be investigated. New method: Proposed extended anatomical covariance analysis (eACA), analyzes correlations among gray and white matter structures (multi-structural) in various types of imaging modalities (T1-weighted images, T2 maps obtained from dual-echo sequences, and diffusion tensor images (DTI)). To demonstrate the capability to detect a disruption of the correlation network affected by pathology, we applied the eACA to two groups of cognitively-normal elderly individuals, one with (PiB+) and one without (PiB-) amyloid deposition in their brains. Results: The volume of each anatomical structure was symmetric and functionally related structures formed a cluster. The pseudo-T2 value was highly homogeneous across the entire cortex in the PiB- group, while a number of physiological correlations were altered in the PiB + group. The DTI demonstrated unique correlation network among structures within the same phylogenetic portions of the brain that were altered in the PiB + group.

This study compares the number of chronic conditions, health services utilization and access to care between patients with Medicaid coverage and uninsured patients seen at US health centres. Methods: We used data from the 2014 Health Center Patient Survey. Measures included number of chronic conditions, number of physician visits, number of prescription drugs used, access to a usual source of care, the receipt of a routine checkup, unmet need for care and unmet need for prescription drugs. We conducted bivariate analyses to determine differences of outcome measures between the Medicaid and uninsured patient groups. Multiple linear and logistic regression models were conducted to test associations of Medicaid and other health-related factors with outcome measures. Results: Bivariate results indicated there were no differences between Medicaid and uninsured patients in number of chronic diseases, having a usual source of care and receipt of a routine checkup. Significant differences existed in health services utilization measures and unmet health needs measures. After controlling for confounding factors, the differences in these measures were still apparent. Uninsured status was linked to a reduced physician visit frequency by −3.03 (95% CI: −4.05, −2.00) as compared with Medicaid patients (p < 0.001) and was associated with a reduced frequency of prescription drugs used by −0.38 (95% CI: −0.67, −0.10, p < 0.01) after controlling for the other covariates. Conclusion: Despite having comparable needs to Medicaid patients, uninsured patients with chronic conditions continue to have substantial unmet needs for health care services and limited access to the health care system.

The association of weight loss with functional decline in peripheral artery disease is unknown. Methods and Results-Adults with an ankle-brachial index <0.90 were identified from Chicago-area hospitals in 2002-2004. Weight and 6-minute walk distance were measured annually. Weight change categories were weight loss or gain (≥5 pounds/year at ≥1 visit) or stable (weight change <5 pounds at each visit). Participants reported whether weight loss was “intentional” or “unintentional.” Calf muscle area was measured with computed tomography every 2 years. Associations of weight change with changes in calf muscle area and 6-minute walk distance were analyzed using mixed-effects models and adjusted for age, body mass index, ankle-brachial index, physical activity, and other confounders. Among 389 participants, mean ankle-brachial index was 0.63±0.16, mean age was 74.5±7.8, and mean body mass index was 28.1±5.1 kg/m2. Over 3.23±1.37 years, muscle area declined more in adults with intentional weight loss versus stable or gain (pair-wise comparisons, P<0.001).

While (R)-ketamine has lower potency than (R,S)-ketamine to inhibit NMDA receptors in vitro, the extent to which (R)-ketamine shares the NMDA receptor-mediated adverse effects of (R,S)-ketamine in vivo has not been fully characterised. Furthermore, (R)-ketamine is metabolised to (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK), which may contribute to its antidepressant-relevant actions. Experimental Approach: Using mice, we compared (R)-ketamine with a deuterated form of the drug (6,6-dideutero-(R)-ketamine, (R)-d2-ketamine), which hinders its metabolism to (2R,6R)-HNK, in behavioural tests predicting antidepressant responses. We also examined the actions of intracerebroventricularly infused (2R,6R)-HNK. Further, we quantified putative NMDA receptor inhibition-mediated adverse effects of (R)-ketamine. Key Results: (R)-d2-Ketamine was identical to (R)-ketamine in binding to and functionally inhibiting NMDA receptors but hindered (R)-ketamine's metabolism to (2R,6R)-HNK. (R)-Ketamine exerted greater potency than (R)-d2-ketamine in several antidepressant-sensitive behavioural measures, consistent with a role of (2R,6R)-HNK in the actions of (R)-ketamine. There were dose-dependent sustained antidepressant-relevant actions of (2R,6R)-HNK following intracerebroventricular administration. (R)-Ketamine exerted NMDA receptor inhibition-mediated behaviours similar to (R,S)-ketamine, including locomotor stimulation, conditioned-place preference, prepulse inhibition deficits, and motor incoordination, with approximately half the potency of the racemic drug. Conclusions and Implications: Metabolism of (R)-ketamine to (2R,6R)-HNK increases the potency of (R)-ketamine to exert antidepressant-relevant actions in mice. Adverse effects of (R)-ketamine require higher doses than those necessary for antidepressant-sensitive behavioural changes in mice. However, our data revealing that (R)-ketamine's adverse effects are elicited at sub-anaesthetic doses indicate a potential risk for sensory dissociation and abuse liability.",73,30941749,Journal,ar,Article,100,12,12,NA,20084,NIH,HHSN‐271‐ 2008‐025C,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,225,NA,NA

Being a nucleolar protein, during DNA damage, WRN translocates at the damage site where its catalytic function is required in DNA repair. Several studies have indicated that WRN acetylation may modulate WRN trafficking and catalytic function (Blander et al., 2002; Lozada et al., 2014). Among the six acetylation sites in WRN protein identified by mass-spectrometry analysis (Li et al., 2010)we here explore the role of acetylation sites in C-terminal of WRN (K1127, K1117, K1389, K1413)because the C- terminal domain is the hub for protein- protein interaction and DNA binding activity (Brosh et al. [4]; Muftuoglu et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2006). To explore their functional activity, we created mutations in these sites by changing the acetylation residue lysine (K)to a non-acetylation residue arginine (R)and expressed them in WRN mutant cell lines. We observed that K1127R and K1117R mutants are sensitive to the DNA damaging agents etoposide and mitomycin C and display deficient DNA repair. Importantly, deacetylation of WRN by SIRT1 (Mammalian Sir2)is necessary for restoration of WRN localization at nucleoli after completion of DNA repair. Among all putative acetylation sites, K1127R, K1117R and the double mutant K1127R/K1117R showed significantly delayed re-entry to the nucleolus after damage recovery, even when SIRT1 is overexpressed. These mutants showed partial interaction with SIRT1 compared to WT WRN. Thus, our results suggest that K1127 and K1117 are the major sites of acetylation, necessary for DNA repair.

Methods: We use GREML-LDMS to estimate narrow-sense heritability due to additive effects (h2) and GREMLd to calculate non-additive heritability due to dominance variance (δ2) using data from 1,751 ET cases and 5,311 controls. We evaluate heritability per 10 Mb segments across the genome and assess the impact of Parkinson's disease (PD) misdiagnosis on heritability estimates. We apply genetic risk score (GRS) from PD and restless legs syndrome (RLS) to explore its contribution to ET risk and further assess genetic correlations with 832 traits by Linkage disequilibrium score regression. Results: We estimated ET narrow-sense heritability to be h2 = 75.5% (s.e = ±0.075). In contrast, dominance variance showed insignificant effect on the overall estimates. Heritability split by 10 Mb regions revealed increased estimates at chromosomes 6 and 21. The proportion of genetic variance due to PD misdiagnosed cases was estimated to be 5.33%. PD and RLS GRS were not significantly predictive of ET case-control status. Conclusions: We show for the first time that ET is a highly heritable condition in which additive common variability plays a prominent role. Chromosomes 6 and 21 may contain causative risk variants influencing susceptibility to ET. Despite overlapping symptomatology, ET does not seem to share genetic etiologies with PD or RLS.

In familial cases, an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance is noted with reduced penetrance. Few genes have been associated with the disease including GNAL and CIZ1. A whole exome sequencing study published lately suggested TOR2A and REEP4 as potential candidate genes. Methods: Sanger sequencing of GNAL, CIZ1, TOR2A and REEP4 exons including exon-intron boundaries in 132 patients diagnosed primarily with blepharospasm and/or Meige's syndrome. Results: All variants detected in GNAL, CIZ1 and TOR2A seem to be benign. Sequencing of REEP4 revealed the presence of two nonsynonymous SNVs, one potential splice site variant and one indel all predicted to be damaging by in silico algorithms.

Recently, deep convolution neural network (CNN) has been applied to whole brain segmentation. However, restricted by current GPU memory, 2D based methods, downsampling based 3D CNN methods, and patch-based high-resolution 3D CNN methods have been the de facto standard solutions. 3D patch-based high resolution methods typically yield superior performance among CNN approaches on detailed whole brain segmentation (>100 labels), however, whose performance are still commonly inferior compared with state-of-the-art multi-atlas segmentation methods (MAS) due to the following challenges: (1) a single network is typically used to learn both spatial and contextual information for the patches, (2) limited manually traced whole brain volumes are available (typically less than 50) for training a network. In this work, we propose the spatially localized atlas network tiles (SLANT) method to distribute multiple independent 3D fully convolutional networks (FCN) for high-resolution whole brain segmentation. To address the first challenge, multiple spatially distributed networks were used in the SLANT method, in which each network learned contextual information for a fixed spatial location. To address the second challenge, auxiliary labels on 5111 initially unlabeled scans were created by multi-atlas segmentation for training. Since the method integrated multiple traditional medical image processing methods with deep learning, we developed a containerized pipeline to deploy the end-to-end solution. From the results, the proposed method achieved superior performance compared with multi-atlas segmentation methods, while reducing the computational time from >30 h to 15 min.

We performed a meta-analysis of GWAS studies in adults to identify genetic variants that are associated with proximal femur geometry phenotypes. We analyzed four phenotypes: (i) femoral neck length; (ii) neck-shaft angle; (iii) femoral neck width, and (iv) femoral neck section modulus, estimated from DXA scans using algorithms of hip structure analysis. In the Discovery stage, 10 cohort studies were included in the fixed-effect meta-analysis, with up to 18,719 men and women ages 16 to 93 years. Association analyses were performed with ∼2.5 million polymorphisms under an additive model adjusted for age, body mass index, and height. Replication analyses of meta-GWAS significant loci (at adjusted genomewide significance [GWS], threshold p ≤ 2.6 × 10–8) were performed in seven additional cohorts in silico. We looked up SNPs associated in our analysis, for association with height, bone mineral density (BMD), and fracture. In meta-analysis (combined Discovery and Replication stages), GWS associations were found at 5p15 (IRX1 and ADAMTS16); 5q35 near FGFR4; at 12p11 (in CCDC91); 11q13 (near LRP5 and PPP6R3 (rs7102273)). Several hip geometry signals overlapped with BMD, including LRP5 (chr. 11). Chr. 11 SNP rs7102273 was associated with any-type fracture (p = 7.5 × 10–5).

The ability to regulate the expression at the gene transcription level would be beneficial for reducing the accumulation of these proteins or regulating expression levels of other genes in the CNS. Short interfering RNA molecules can bind specifically to target RNAs and deliver them for degradation. This approach has shown promise therapeutically in vitro and in vivo in mouse models of PD and AD and other neurological disorders; however, delivery of the siRNA to the CNS in vivo has been achieved primarily through intra-cerebral or intra-thecal injections that may be less amenable for clinical translation; therefore, alternative approaches for delivery of siRNAs to the brain is needed. Recently, we described a small peptide from the envelope protein of the rabies virus (C2-9r) that was utilized to deliver an siRNA targeting α-syn across the blood brain barrier (BBB) following intravenous injection. This approach showed reduced expression of α-syn and neuroprotection in a toxic mouse model of PD. However, since receptor-mediated delivery is potentially saturable, each allowing the delivery of a limited number of molecules, we identified an alternative peptide for the transport of nucleotides across the BBB based on the apolipoprotein B (apoB) protein targeted to the family of low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDL-R). We used an 11-amino acid sequence from the apoB protein (ApoB 11 ) that, when coupled with a 9-amino acid arginine linker, can transport siRNAs across the BBB to neuronal and glial cells. To examine the value of this peptide mediated oligonucleotide delivery system for PD, we delivered an siRNA targeting the α-syn (siα-syn) in a transgenic mouse model of PD. We found that ApoB 11 was effective (comparable to C2-9r) at mediating the delivery of siα-syn into the CNS, co-localized to neurons and glial cells and reduced levels of α-syn protein translation and accumulation. Delivery of ApoB 11 /siα-syn was accompanied by protection from degeneration of selected neuronal populations in the neocortex, limbic system and striato-nigral system and reduced neuro-inflammation. Taken together, these results suggest that systemic delivery of oligonucleotides targeting α-syn using ApoB 11 might be an interesting alternative strategy worth considering for the experimental treatment of synucleinopathies.",33,30849508,Journal,ar,Article,100,10,10,Apolipoprotein B | Blood-brain barrier | Low density lipoprotein receptor | Parkinson's disease | Receptor mediated transytosis | siRNA | α-Synuclein,17466,NIH,AG18440,National Institutes of Health,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,236,NA,S0969996119300609

To examine the associations of APOE ε4 and ε2 alleles with risk of developing these syndromes, a total of 991 pathologically-confirmed atypical parkinsonism cases were genotyped using the Illumina NeuroChip array. We also performed genotyping and logistic regression analyses to examine APOE frequency and associated risk in patients with Alzheimer's disease (n = 571) and Parkinson's disease (n = 348).

CHTM1 localizes to both cytosol and mitochondria. Sequence corresponding to CHTM1 is also annotated in the database as CHCHD5. CHTM1 is deregulated in human breast and colon cancers and its deficiency in human cancer cells leads to defective lipid metabolism and poor growth under glucose/glutamine starvation. Methods: Human cancer cell lines and tissue specimens were used. CHTM1 knockdown was done via lentiviral approach. CHTM1-expresssion constructs were developed and mutants were generated via site-directed mutagenesis approach. Western blotting, immunostaining, immunohistochemistry, cell fractionation and luciferase assays were performed. Reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species were also measured. Results: Here we report that CHTM1 deficiency sensitizes human lung cancer cells to metabolic stress-induced cell death mediated by glucose/glutamine deprivation and metformin treatment. CHTM1 interacts with Apoptosis Inducing Factor 1 (AIF1) that is one of the important death inducing molecules. CHTM1 appears to negatively regulate AIF1 by preventing AIF1 translocation to cytosol/nucleus and thereby inhibit AIF1-mediated caspase-independent cell death. Our results also indicate that p38, a stress kinase, plays a critical role in metabolic stress-induced cell death in CHTM1-deficient cells. Furthermore, p38 appears to enhance AIF1 translocation from mitochondria to cytosol particularly in metabolically stressed CHTM1-deficient cells and CHTM1 negatively regulates p38 kinase activity. The expression status of CHTM1 in lung cancer patient samples is also investigated and our results indicate that CHTM1 levels are increased in the majority of lung tumors when compared to their matching normal tissues. Conclusion: Thus, CHTM1 appears to be an important metabolic marker that regulates cancer cell survival under metabolic stress conditions, and has the potential to be developed as a predictive tumor marker.",3,31221176,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,AIF | Cancer metabolism | Cell death | CHCHD5 | Lung cancer | Metabolic stress | p38,29951,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,241,271,NA

Understanding the molecular mechanisms that support preserved cognitive function in aged animals is a critical step toward identifying novel therapeutic targets that could improve memory in aging individuals. One potential mechanism is the Nr4a family of genes, a group of CREB-dependent nuclear orphan receptors that have previously been shown to be important for hippocampal memory formation. Here, using a cross-species approach, we tested the role of Nr4a1 and Nr4a2 in age-related memory impairments. Using a rat model designed to identify individual differences in age-related memory impairments, we first identified Nr4a2 as a key gene that fails to be induced by learning in cognitively impaired male aged rats. Next, using a mouse model that allows for genetic manipulations, we determined that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) negatively regulates Nr4a2 in the aged male and female hippocampus. Finally, we show that overexpression of Nr4a1, Nr4a2, or both transcripts in the male mouse dorsal hippocampus can ameliorate age-related impairments in object location memory. Together, our results suggest that Nr4a2 may be a key mechanism that promotes preserved cognitive function in old age, with HDAC3-mediated repression of Nr4a2 contributing to age-related cognitive decline.

We found that nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (NRF2/ NFE2L2) represses the expression of BACE1 and BACE1-AS through binding to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in their promoters of mouse and human. NRF2-mediated inhibition of BACE1 and BACE1-AS expression is independent of redox regulation. NRF2 activation decreases production of BACE1 and BACE1-AS transcripts and Aβ production and ameliorates cognitive deficits in animal models of AD.

It is believed that Lewy bodies spread throughout the nervous system due to the cell-To-cell propagation of αSyn via cycles of secretion and uptake. Here, we investigated the internalization and intracellular accumulation of exogenous αSyn, two key steps of Lewy body pathogenesis, amplification and spreading. We found that stable αSyn fibrils substantially accumulate in different cell lines upon internalization, whereas αSyn monomers, oligomers, and dissociable fibrils do not. Our data indicate that the uptake-mediated accumulation of αSyn in a human-derived neuroblastoma cell line triggered an adaptive response that involved proteins linked to ubiquitin ligases of the S-phase kinase-Associated protein 1 (SKP1), cullin-1 (Cul1), and F-box domain-containing protein (SCF) family. We found that SKP1, Cul1, and the F-box/LRR repeat protein 5 (FBXL5) colocalized and physically interacted with internalized αSyn in cultured cells. Moreover, the SCF containing the F-box protein FBXL5 (SCFFBXL5) catalyzed αSyn ubiquitination in reconstitution experiments in vitro using recombinant proteins and in cultured cells. In the human brain, SKP1 and Cul1 were recruited into Lewy bodies from brainstem and neocortex of patients with PD and related neurological disorders. In both transgenic and nontransgenic mice, intracerebral administration of exogenous αSyn fibrils triggered a Lewy body-like pathology, which was amplified by SKP1 or FBXL5 loss of function.

Immature P. falciparum transmission stages, termed stages I to IV gametocytes, sequester in human bone marrow before release into the circulation as mature stage V gametocytes. This process likely involves interactions between host receptors and potentially immunogenic adhesins on the infected red blood cell (iRBC) surface. Here, we developed a flow cytometry assay to examine immune recognition of live gametocytes of different developmental stages by naturally exposed Malawians. We identified strong antibody recognition of the earliest immature gametocyte-iRBCs (giRBCs) but not mature stage V giRBCs. Candidate surface antigens (n = 30), most of them shared between asexual-and gametocyte-iRBCs, were identified by mass spectrometry and mouse immunizations, as well as correlations between responses by protein microarray and flow cytometry. Naturally acquired responses to a subset of candidate antigens were associated with reduced asexual and gametocyte density, and plasma samples from malaria-infected individuals were able to induce immune clearance of giRBCs in vitro. Infected RBC surface expression of select candidate antigens was validated using specific antibodies, and genetic analysis revealed a subset with minimal variation across strains. Our data demonstrate that humoral immune responses to immature giRBCs and shared iRBC antigens are naturally acquired after malaria exposure.

Results: Here we introduce an assay termed cross-link (XL)-DNase-seq, designed to capture chromatin interactions of dynamic TFs. Mild cross-linking improved the detection of DNase-based footprints of dynamic TFs but interfered with ATAC-based footprinting of the same TFs.

However, under abnormal conditions, Ca leaks from the SR, decreasing heart contraction amplitude and increasing risk of life-threatening arrhythmia. The mechanisms and regimes of SR operation generating the abnormal Ca leak remain unclear. Here, we employed both numerical and analytical modeling to get mechanistic insights into the emergent Ca leak phenomenon. Our numerical simulations using a detailed realistic model of the Ca release unit reveal sharp transitions resulting in Ca leak. The emergence of leak is closely mapped mathematically to the Ising model from statistical mechanics. The system steady-state behavior is determined by two aggregate parameters: the analogs of magnetic field (h)and the inverse temperature (β)in the Ising model, for which we have explicit formulas in terms of SR [Ca]and release channel opening and closing rates. The classification of leak regimes takes the shape of a phase β-h diagram, with the regime boundaries occurring at h = 0 and a critical value of β (β∗)that we estimate using a classical Ising model and mean field theory. Our theory predicts that a synchronized Ca leak will occur when h > 0 and β > β∗, and a disordered leak occurs when β < β∗ and h is not too negative. The disorder leak is distinguished from synchronized leak (in long-lasting sparks)by larger Peierls contour lengths, an output parameter reflecting degree of disorder. Thus, in addition to our detailed numerical model approach, we also offer an instantaneous computational tool using analytical formulas of the Ising model for respective ryanodine receptor parameters and SR Ca load that describe and classify phase transitions and leak emergence.",8,31103231,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,NA,14859,NIH,ZIAAG000844,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,249,NA,S0006349519303753

Decreased expression of Cyp24a1 in susceptible strains was associated with genetic alterations in noncoding regions of Cyp24a1 gene, which were strongly reminiscent of super-enhancers that regulate gene expression. These observations suggest that higher basal expression of an enzyme required for catabolizing vitamin D renders B6-kl/kl mice less susceptible to changes in Klotho expression, providing a plausible explanation for the lack of aging phenotypes on C57BL/6 strain.",5,30920112,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,aging | genetic background | klotho-hypomorphic allele | vitamin D metabolism,18391,NIH,AG000771,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,259,e12949,NA

Sarcopenia increases the risk of falls, disability, and death. The biological basis for sarcopenia is not well understood. There are no specific preventive or therapeutic strategies for sarcopenia except exercise. The elucidation of biological pathways and identification of therapeutic targets for treating or preventing sarcopenia remain a high priority in aging research. Mitochondria play a critical role in skeletal muscle by providing energy in the form of ATP, regulation of signaling, calcium homeostasis, autophagy, and other functions. Cardiolipin, a unique dimeric phospholipid specific to mitochondria and an essential component of mitochondrial membranes, is involved in mitochondrial protein transport, maintaining structural organization of mitochondrial membranes, cellular signaling, regulating enzymes involved in β-oxidation of fatty acids, and facilitating normal electron transport chain (ETC) function and generation of ATP. The fatty acid species composition of cardiolipin is critical to mitochondrial bioenergetics, as cardiolipin affects membrane biophysical properties, binds and stabilizes ETC protein complexes, and shapes the curvature of the mitochondrial cristae. Tetra-linoleoyl cardiolipin (18:2)4 comprises ∼80% of cardiolipin in mitochondria in normal human skeletal and cardiac muscle and is optimal for effective ETC function and ATP generation. Aging is associated with a decrease in cardiolipin content, decrease in tetra-linoleoyl cardiolipin (18:2)4 and replacement of linoleic acid (18:2) with other fatty acids in cardiolipin composition, decline of ETC function, and increased generation of reactive oxygen species in muscle. Together, these findings from the literature prompt the hypothesis that depletion of the cardiolipin (18:2)4 species may be at the root of mitochondrial dysfunction with aging, in turn leading to sarcopenia. Corroboration of the tetra-linoleoyl cardiolipin depletion hypothesis suggests new leads for the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia by enhancing the biosynthesis, accretion, and integrity of tetra-linoleoyl cardiolipin.",25,31088638,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Aging | Cardiolipin | Lipids | Mitochondria | Sarcopenia,17833,NIH,R01EY024596,National Institutes of Health,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,260,NA,S0306987719300556

Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shed light on the genetic basis of risk for this disease. However, the genetic determinants of PD age at onset are largely unknown. Objectives: To identify the genetic determinants of PD age at onset. Methods: Using genetic data of 28,568 PD cases, we performed a genome-wide association study based on PD age at onset. Results: We estimated that the heritability of PD age at onset attributed to common genetic variation was ∼0.11, lower than the overall heritability of risk for PD (∼0.27), likely, in part, because of the subjective nature of this measure. We found two genome-wide significant association signals, one at SNCA and the other a protein-coding variant in TMEM175, both of which are known PD risk loci and a Bonferroni-corrected significant effect at other known PD risk loci, GBA, INPP5F/BAG3, FAM47E/SCARB2, and MCCC1. Notably, SNCA, TMEM175, SCARB2, BAG3, and GBA have all been shown to be implicated in α-synuclein aggregation pathways. Remarkably, other well-established PD risk loci, such as GCH1 and MAPT, did not show a significant effect on age at onset of PD. Conclusions: Overall, we have performed the largest age at onset of PD genome-wide association studies to date, and our results show that not all PD risk loci influence age at onset with significant differences between risk alleles for age at onset. This provides a compelling picture, both within the context of functional characterization of disease-linked genetic variability and in defining differences between risk alleles for age at onset, or frank risk for disease. © 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",249,30957308,Journal,ar,Article,100,42,42,age at onset | GBA | Parkinson's disease | SNCA | TMEM175,17407,NIH,DFG SH599/6-1,National Institutes of Health,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,261,NA,NA

Herein, we propose a big data registration-enhancement (BDRE) technique to augment the contrast of deep brain structures using an efficient large-scale non-rigid registration strategy. Direct validation is problematic given a lack of ground truth data. Rather, we validate the usefulness and impact of BDRE for multi-atlas (MA) segmentation on two sets of structures of clinical interest: the thalamic nuclei and hippocampal subfields. The experimental design compares algorithms using T1-weighted 3 T MRI for both structures (and additional 7 T MRI for the thalamic nuclei) with an algorithm using BDRE. As baseline comparisons, a recent denoising (DN) technique and a super-resolution (SR) method are used to preprocess the original 3 T MRI. The performance of each MA segmentation is evaluated by the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). BDRE significantly improves mean segmentation accuracy over all methods tested for both thalamic nuclei (3 T imaging: 9.1%; 7 T imaging: 15.6%; DN: 6.9%; SR: 16.2%) and hippocampal subfields (3 T T1 only: 8.7%; DN: 8.4%; SR: 8.6%).

Using a new epigenetic aging measure, Levine DNAmAge, this study aimed to investigate whether epigenetic aging accounts for mortality disparities by race/ethnicity and education in a sample of U.S. postmenopausal women. Methods: 1834 participants from an ancillary study (BA23) in the Women's Health Initiative, a national study that recruited postmenopausal women (50–79 years) were included. Over the 22 years of follow-up, 551 women died, and 31,946 person-years were observed. Levine DNAmAge (unit in years) was calculated based on an equation that we previously developed in an independent sample, which incorporates methylation levels at 513 CpG sites. Results: As previously reported, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics were epigenetically older than non-Hispanic whites of the same chronological age. Similarly, those with less education had older epigenetic ages than expected in the full sample, as well as among non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics, but not among non-Hispanic blacks. Non-Hispanic blacks and those with low education exhibited the greatest risk of mortality. However, this association was partially attenuated when accounting for differences in DNAmAge. Furthermore, formal mediation analysis suggested that DNAmAge partially mediated the mortality increase among non-Hispanic blacks, compared to non-Hispanic whites (proportion mediated, 15.8%, P = 0.002), as well as the mortality increase for those with less than high school education, compared to college educated (proportion mediated, 11.6%, P < 2E-16).

Genome-wide CpG methylation was assayed using the Illumina Infinium Human MethylationEPIC (HM850K) microarray. Results: Global patterns in DNA methylation from CpG-based analyses showed extensive changes in cell composition over time in participants who developed cancer.

Analysis of within-individual change from baseline to Year 6 found significant correlations between the rates of change in methylation in RPTOR, REC8 and ZSWIM5, and time to cancer diagnosis. Conclusion: The results show that changes in cellular composition explains much of the cross-sectional and longitudinal variation in CpG methylation.

To address this uncertainty and inform international recommendations, we evaluated how in vivo circulating and tissue levels of linoleic acid (LA) and arachidonic acid (AA) relate to incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) across multiple international studies. Methods: We performed harmonized, de novo, individual-level analyses in a global consortium of 30 prospective observational studies from 13 countries. Multivariable-adjusted associations of circulating and adipose tissue LA and AA biomarkers with incident total CVD and subtypes (coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, cardiovascular mortality) were investigated according to a prespecified analytic plan. Levels of LA and AA, measured as the percentage of total fatty acids, were evaluated linearly according to their interquintile range (ie, the range between the midpoint of the first and fifth quintiles), and categorically by quintiles. Study-specific results were pooled using inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was explored by age, sex, race, diabetes mellitus, statin use, aspirin use, omega-3 levels, and fatty acid desaturase 1 genotype (when available). Results: In 30 prospective studies with medians of follow-up ranging 2.5 to 31.9 years, 15 198 incident cardiovascular events occurred among 68 659 participants. Higher levels of LA were significantly associated with lower risks of total CVD, cardiovascular mortality, and ischemic stroke, with hazard ratios per interquintile range of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.88-0.99), 0.78 (0.70-0.85), and 0.88 (0.79-0.98), respectively, and nonsignificantly with lower coronary heart disease risk (0.94; 0.88-1.00). Relationships were similar for LA evaluated across quintiles. AA levels were not associated with higher risk of cardiovascular outcomes; in a comparison of extreme quintiles, higher levels were associated with lower risk of total CVD (0.92; 0.86-0.99). No consistent heterogeneity by population subgroups was identified in the observed relationships.

Recently, the O’Donnell laboratory has been better able to map the interactions of Mcm10 with a larger Cdc45/GINS/MCM (CMG) unwinding complex placing it at the front of the replication fork. They have shown biochemically that Mcm10 has the impressive ability to strip off single-strand binding protein (RPA) and reanneal complementary DNA strands. This has major implications in controlling DNA unwinding speed as well as responding to various situations where fork reversal is needed.

However, it is difficult to maintain over a lifetime in postmitotic cells such as neurons, in which DNA damage increases with age and is exacerbated by multiple neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we used immunohistochemical staining to detect DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), the most severe form of DNA damage, in postmortem brain tissues from patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD and from cognitively unimpaired controls. Immunostaining for γH2AX - a post-translational histone modification that is widely used as a marker of DSBs - revealed increased proportions of γH2AX-labeled neurons and astrocytes in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of MCI and AD patients, as compared to age-matched controls. In contrast to the focal pattern associated with DSBs, some neurons and glia in humans and mice showed diffuse pan-nuclear patterns of γH2AX immunoreactivity. In mouse brains and primary neuronal cultures, such pan-nuclear γH2AX labeling could be elicited by increasing neuronal activity. To assess whether pan-nuclear γH2AX represents DSBs, we used a recently developed technology, DNA damage in situ ligation followed by proximity ligation assay, to detect close associations between γH2AX sites and free DSB ends. This assay revealed no evidence of DSBs in neurons or astrocytes with prominent pan-nuclear γH2AX labeling. These findings suggest that focal, but not pan-nuclear, increases in γH2AX immunoreactivity are associated with DSBs in brain tissue and that these distinct patterns of γH2AX formation may have different causes and consequences. We conclude that AD is associated with an accumulation of DSBs in vulnerable neuronal and glial cell populations from early stages onward. Because of the severe adverse effects this type of DNA damage can have on gene expression, chromatin stability and cellular functions, DSBs could be an important causal driver of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in this disease.",152,31101070,Journal,ar,Article,100,9,9,53BP1 | Alzheimer's disease | Astrocytes | DNA damage | Neurons | γH2AX,21100367530,NIH,AARF-16-441393,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,274,77,NA

Aims: To determine the relationship between gray matter volume (GMV), white matter hyperintensities (WMH), mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) with lateral postural control. Methods: Neuroimaging and postural control were assessed in 193 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 82, 55.4% female, 44.6% black). GMV, WMH, and diffusion tensor-derived markers of microstructure (MD and FA) were quantified for total brain and regions of interest.

Lesser known is the contribution of IL-6 to fatigue in relation to a standardized workload (fatigability), a precursor to functional decline. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the longitudinal relationship between IL-6 and fatigability. Methods: About 985 participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (mean age: 70 ± 10 years) were evaluated every 1-4 years.

Perceived fatigability (PF) was defined as self-reported exertion (rate of perceived exertion; RPE) after a 5-min, 0.67 m/s, 0% grade treadmill walk. Continuous and categorical associations between IL-6 (baseline and repeated measures) and PF were assessed using generalized estimating equations, adjusting for demographics, behavioral factors, and comorbid conditions. Results: In fully adjusted continuous models, twofold higher baseline IL-6 was associated with a 0.28 higher RPE (p =.03). This relationship tended to remain constant annually (baseline log IL-6 by time interaction p =.29). To provide clinical relevance, the sample median (3.7 pg/mL) was used to examine high versus low IL-6 levels. Over time, the high group reported an average 0.25 higher RPE (p =.03) than the low group. Annual change in logged IL-6 was not associated with annual change in PF (p =.48).

We investigated how retinal vessel structure captured in fundus photographs changes with age, and how this may reflect features related to patient health, including blood pressure. Results We used two approaches. In the first approach, we segmented the retinal vasculature from fundus photographs and then we correlated 25 parameterized aspects (""traits"")—comprising 15 measures of tortuosity, 7 fractal ranges of self-similarity, and 3 measures of junction numbers—with participant age and blood pressure. In the second approach, we examined entire fundus photographs with a set of algorithmic CHARM features. We studied 2,280 Sardinians, ages 20–28, and an U.S. based population from the AREDS study in 1,178 participants, ages 59–84. Three traits (relating to tortuosity, vessel bifurcation number, and vessel endpoint number) showed significant changes with age in both cohorts, and one additional trait (relating to fractal number) showed a correlation in the Sardinian cohort only. When using second approach, we found significant correlations of particular CHARM features with age and blood pressure, which were stronger than those detected when using parameterized traits, reflecting a greater signal from the entire photographs than was captured in the segmented microvasculature.

Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) plays a critical role in the regulation of whole-body energy metabolism because of its involvement in controlling appetite, fuel distribution, and utilization. Inhibition of CB1R improves insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity in pancreatic β-cells and hepatocytes. We have now developed a skeletal muscle–specific CB1R-knockout (Skm-CB1R−/−) mouse to study the specific role of CB1R in muscle. Muscle-CB1R ablation prevented diet-induced and age-induced insulin resistance by increasing IR signaling. Moreover, muscle-CB1R ablation enhanced AKT signaling, reducing myostatin expression and increasing IL-6 secretion. Subsequently, muscle-CB1R ablation increased myogenesis through its action on MAPK-mediated myogenic gene expression. Consequently, Skm-CB1R−/− mice had increased muscle mass and whole-body lean/fat ratio in obesity and aging. Muscle-CB1R ablation improved mitochondrial performance, leading to increased whole-body muscle energy expenditure and improved physical endurance, with no change in body weight. These results collectively show that CB1R in muscle is sufficient to regulate whole-body metabolism and physical performance and is a novel target for the treatment of sarcopenic obesity. —González-Mariscal, I., Montoro, R.

GCIs are known to interfere with oligodendroglial maturation and consequently result in myelin loss. The neuroinflammatory phenotype in the context of MSA, however, remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate MSA-associated neuroinflammation being restricted to myeloid cells and tightly linked to oligodendroglial α-syncleinopathy. In human putaminal post-mortem tissue of MSA patients, neuroinflammation was observed in white matter regions only. This locally restricted neuroinflammation coincided with elevated numbers of α-syn inclusions, while gray matter with less α-synucleinopathy remained unaffected. In order to analyze the temporal pattern of neuroinflammation, a transgenic mouse model overexpressing human α-syn under the control of an oligodendrocyte-specific myelin basic protein (MBP) promoter (MBP29-hα-syn mice) was assessed in a pre-symptomatic and symptomatic disease stage. Strikingly, we detected an increased neuroinflammation in regions with a high α-syn load, the corpus callosum and the striatum, of MBP29-hα-syn mice, already at a pre-symptomatic stage. Furthermore, this inflammatory response was restricted to myeloid cells being highly proliferative and showing an activated, phagocytic phenotype. In contrast, severe astrogliosis was observed only in gray matter regions of MSA patients as well as MBP29-hα-syn mice. To further characterize the influence of oligodendrocytes on initiation of the myeloid immune response, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of α-syn overexpressing primary oligodendrocytes. A distinct gene expression profile including upregulation of cytokines important for myeloid cell attraction and proliferation was detected in α-syn overexpressing oligodendrocytes. Additionally, microdissected tissue of MBP29-hα-syn mice exhibited a similar cellular gene expression profile in white matter regions even pre-symptomatically.

Ovarian cancer employs a unique mode of metastasis, as exfoliated tumor cells disseminate within the peritoneal cavity, colonizing in several sites as well as accumulating ascites. Tumor recurrence and widespread metastasis are significant factors contributing to poor prognosis. PRSS21 is a metastasis-associated ovarian cancer gene that encodes the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked serine protease, testisin. Testisin expression is increased in multiple ovarian tumor types, with relatively little expression in normal tissues, but is differentially decreased in metastatic ovarian serous carcinomas compared to primary tumors. Here we explored the function of testisin in late-stage ovarian cancer progression using a murine xenograft model of ovarian intraperitoneal tumor metastasis. Increased tumor testisin expression inhibited intra-peritoneal tumor seeding and colonization, ascites accumulation, and metastatic tumor burden that was dependent on catalytically active testisin. The known testisin substrate, protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), is a target of testisin activity. Gene profiling and mechanistic studies demonstrate that testisin activity suppresses the synthesis and secretion of pro-angiogenic angiopoietins, ANG2 and ANGPTL4, which normally promote vascular leak and edema. These observations support a model wherein testisin activates PAR-2 to antagonize proangiogenic angiopoietins that modulate vascular permeability and ascites accumulation associated with ovarian tumor metastasis. Key messages: Testisin inhibits metastatic ovarian tumor burden and ascites production.Testisin activity antagonizes ANG2 and ANGPTL4 synthesis and secretion.PAR-2 is a proteolytic target of testisin on the surface of ovarian cancer cells.",22,30911775,Journal,ar,Article,100,8,8,ANG2 | Ascites | Ovarian metastasis | Serine protease | Testisin,15984,NIH,R01 HL118390,National Institutes of Health,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,293,NA,NA

Impaired muscle perfusion may result in inadequate delivery of oxygen and nutrients during and after muscle contraction, leading to muscle damage. The ability to study the relationship between perfusion and muscle damage has been limited using traditional muscle perfusion measures, which are invasive and risky. To overcome this limitation, we optimized a diffusion-weighted MRI sequence and validated an intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) analysis based on Monte Carlo simulation to study muscle perfusion impairment with aging during post-exercise hyperemia. Simulation results demonstrated that the bias of IVIM-derived perfusion fraction (f p ) and diffusion of water molecules in extra-vascular tissue (D) ranged from −3.3% to 14% and from −16.5% to 0.002%, respectively, in the optimized experimental condition.

This can lead to incorrect fiber orientation estimates and subsequent tractography failure. Here, we present an automated quality control procedure to detect when the b-table is flipped and/or permuted incorrectly. Methods: We define a “fiber coherence index” to describe how well fibers are connected to each other, and use it to automatically detect the correct configuration of b-vectors. We examined the performance on 3981 research subject scans (Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging), 1065 normal subject scans of high image quality (Human Connectome Project), and 202 patient scans (Vanderbilt University Medical Center), as well as 9 in-vivo and 9 ex-vivo animal data. Results: The coherence index resulted in a 99.9% (3979/3981) and 100% (1065/1065) success rate in normal subject scans, 98% (198/202) in patient scans, and 100% (18/18) in both in-vivo and ex-vivo animal data in detecting the correct gradient table in datasets without severe image artifacts. The four failing cases (4/202) in patient scans, and two failures in healthy subject scans (2/3981), all showed prominent motion or signal dropout artifacts.

A HAI, which ranges from 0 to 10, was constructed at years 1 and 10 of the study including systolic blood pressure, forced expiratory volume, digit symbol substitution test, cystatin C, and fasting glucose. The relationships between the HAI at years 1 and 10 and the change between years and subsequent mortality until year 17 were estimated from Cox proportional hazards models.

We describe how administrative data (from participating health systems and Medicare claims) can be used to confirm participant-reported events, with more time- and resource-intensive full-text medical record data used only on an ""as-needed"" basis. Methods: STRIDE is a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial involving 5451 participants age ≥ 70 and at increased risk for falls, served by 86 primary care practices in 10 US health systems. The STRIDE intervention involves a nurse falls care manager who assesses a participant's underlying risks for falls, suggests interventions using motivational interviewing, and then creates, implements and longitudinally follows up on an individualized care plan with the participant (and caregiver when appropriate), in partnership with the participant's primary care provider. STRIDE's primary outcome is serious fall injuries, defined as a fall resulting in: (1) medical attention billable according to Medicare guidelines with a) fracture (excluding isolated thoracic vertebral and/or lumbar vertebral fracture), b) joint dislocation, or c) cut requiring closure; OR (2) overnight hospitalization with a) head injury, b) sprain or strain, c) bruising or swelling, or d) other injury determined to be ""serious"" (i.e., burn, rhabdomyolysis, or internal injury). Two sources of data are required to confirm a serious fall injury. The primary data source is the participant's self-report of a fall leading to medical attention, identified during telephone interview every 4 months, with the confirmatory source being (1) administrative data capturing encounters at the participating health systems or Medicare claims and/or (2) the full text of medical records requested only as needed. Discussion: Adjudication is ongoing, with over 1000 potentially qualifying events adjudicated to date. Administrative data can be successfully used for adjudication, as part of a hybrid approach that retrieves full-text medical records only when needed. With the continued refinement and availability of administrative data sources, future studies may be able to use administrative data completely in lieu of medical record review to maximize the quality of adjudication with finite resources.

RNA sequencing analysis revealed many mRNAs showing differential abundance in NF90-silenced cells, many of them encoding proteins implicated in the response to immune stimuli and malaria infection. The transcription of some of them (e.g. TNF, LILRB1, and CCL2 mRNAs) was modulated by silencing NF90. Ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation (RIP) analysis further revealed that a subset of these mRNAs associated directly with NF90. To understand how NF90 influenced globally the immune response to malaria infection, lysates of red blood cells infected with Plasmodium falciparum (iRBC lysates) or uninfected/mock-infected (uRBC lysates) were used to treat THP-1 cells as a surrogate of malaria infection. NF90 affected the stability of a few target mRNAs, but influenced more generally the translation and secretion of the encoded cytokines after treatment with either uRBC or iRBC lysates.

Once infected, it is difficult for the host to clear this organism using the innate immune system. Increased antibiotic resistance further makes it challenging for effective eradication. However, the mechanisms of immune evasion still remain obscure, and novel strategies should be developed to efficiently eliminate H. pylori infection in stomachs. Here we uncovered desirable anti-H. pylori effect of vitamin D3 both in vitro and in vivo, even against antibiotic-resistant strains. We showed that H. pylori can invade into the gastric epithelium where they became sequestered and survived in autophagosomes with impaired lysosomal acidification. Vitamin D3 treatment caused a restored lysosomal degradation function by activating the PDIA3 receptor, thereby promoting the nuclear translocation of PDIA3-STAT3 protein complex and the subsequent upregulation of MCOLN3 channels, resulting in an enhanced Ca 2+ release from lysosomes and normalized lysosomal acidification. The recovered lysosomal degradation function drives H. pylori to be eliminated through the autolysosomal pathway.

After cerebral ischemia, inflammation plays a central role in the development of permanent neurological damage. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the mechanism of post-ischemic inflammation. The activation of several inflammatory enzymes produces ROS, which subsequently suppress mitochondrial activity, leading to further tissue damage. Pomalidomide (POM) is a clinically available immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory agent. Prior cellular studies demonstrate that POM can mitigate oxidative stress and lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-α, which plays a prominent role in ischemic stroke-induced brain damage and functional deficits. To evaluate the potential value of POM in cerebral ischemia, POM was initially administered to transgenic mice chronically over-expressing TNF-α surfactant protein (SP)-C promoter (SP-C/TNF-α mice) to assess whether systemically administered drug could lower systemic TNF-α level. POM significantly lowered serum levels of TNF-α and IL-5. Pharmacokinetic studies were then undertaken in mice to evaluate brain POM levels following systemic drug administration. POM possessed a brain/plasma concentration ratio of 0.71. Finally, rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) for 60 min, and subsequently treated with POM 30 min thereafter to evaluate action on cerebral ischemia. POM reduced the cerebral infarct volume in MCAo-challenged rats and improved motor activity, as evaluated by the elevated body swing test.

Recent research in humans suggests that one important driver of aging is dysregulation, the progressive loss of homeostasis in complex biological networks. Yet, there is a lack of comparative data for this hypothesis, and we do not know whether dysregulation is widely associated with aging or how well signals of homeostasis are conserved. To address this knowledge gap, we use unusually detailed longitudinal biomarker data from 10 species of nonhuman primates housed in research centers and data from two human populations to test the hypotheses that (a) greater dysregulation is associated with aging across primates and (b) physiological states characterizing homeostasis are conserved across primates to degrees associated with phylogenetic proximity. To evaluate dysregulation, we employed a multivariate distance measure, calculated from sets of biomarkers, that is associated with aging and mortality in human populations. Dysregulation scores positively correlated with age and risk of mortality in most nonhuman primates studied, and signals of homeostatic state were significantly conserved across species, declining with phylogenetic distance.

However, it is not known whether the DNAm age of donor blood remains independent of the recipient's age over the long term. Importantly, long-term studies including child recipients have the potential to clearly reveal whether DNAm age is cell-intrinsic or whether it is modulated by extracellular cues in vivo. Here, we address this question by analyzing blood methylation data from HSCT donor and recipient pairs who greatly differed in chronological age (age differences between 1 and 49 years). We found that the DNAm age of the reconstituted blood was not influenced by the recipient's age, even 17 years after HSCT, in individuals without relapse of their hematologic disorder. However, the DNAm age of recipients with relapse of leukemia was unstable. These data are consistent with our previous findings concerning the abnormal DNAm age of cancer cells, and it can potentially be exploited to monitor the health of HSCT recipients.

In recent years, several genes from the endocytic membrane-trafficking pathway have been suggested to contribute to disease etiology. However, a systematic analysis of pathway-specific genetic risk factors is yet to be performed. Objectives: To comprehensively study the role of the endocytic membrane-trafficking pathway in the risk of PD. Methods: Linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to estimate PD heritability explained by 252 genes involved in the endocytic membrane-trafficking pathway including genome-wide association studies data from 18,869 cases and 22,452 controls. We used pathway-specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms to construct a polygenic risk score reflecting the cumulative risk of common variants. To prioritize genes for follow-up functional studies, summary-data based Mendelian randomization analyses were applied to explore possible functional genomic associations with expression or methylation quantitative trait loci. Results: The heritability estimate attributed to endocytic membrane-trafficking pathway was 3.58% (standard error = 1.17). Excluding previously nominated PD endocytic membrane-trafficking pathway genes, the missing heritability was 2.21% (standard error = 0.42). Random heritability simulations were estimated to be 1.44% (standard deviation = 0.54), indicating that the unbiased total heritability explained by the endocytic membrane-trafficking pathway was 2.14%. Polygenic risk score based on endocytic membrane-trafficking pathway showed a 1.25 times increase of PD risk per standard deviation of genetic risk. Finally, Mendelian randomization identified 11 endocytic membrane-trafficking pathway genes showing functional consequence associated to PD risk. Conclusions: We provide compelling genetic evidence that the endocytic membrane-trafficking pathway plays a relevant role in disease etiology.

Accumulating evidence suggests that impaired brain insulin and protein kinase B (Akt) signaling play a role in PD pathogenesis; however, exploring the extent to which drugs engage with putative mechnisms in vivo remains a challenge. Objective: To assess whether participants in the Exenatide-PD trial have augmented activity in brain insulin and Akt signaling pathways. Design, Setting, and Participants: Serum samples were collected from 60 participants in the single-center Exenatide-PD trial (June 18, 2014, to June 16, 2016), which compared patients with moderate PD randomized to 2 mg of exenatide once weekly or placebo for 48 weeks followed by a 12-week washout period. Serum extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, were extracted, precipitated, and enriched for neuronal source by anti-L1 cell adhesion molecule antibody absorption, and proteins of interest were evaluated using electrochemiluminescence assays. Statistical analysis was performed from May 1, 2017, to August 31, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was augmented brain insulin signaling that manifested as a change in tyrosine phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate 1 within neuronal extracellular vesicles at the end of 48 weeks of exenatide treatment. Additional outcome measures were changes in other insulin receptor substrate proteins and effects on protein expression in the Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Results: Sixty patients (mean [SD] age, 59.9 [8.4] years; 43 [72%] male) participated in the study: 31 in the exenatide group and 29 in the placebo group (data from 1 patient in the exenatide group were excluded). Patients treated with exenatide had augmented tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 at 48 weeks (0.27 absorbance units [AU]; 95% CI, 0.09-0.44 AU; P =.003) and 60 weeks (0.23 AU; 95% CI, 0.05-0.41 AU; P =.01) compared with patients receiving placebo. Exenatide-treated patients had elevated expression of downstream substrates, including total Akt (0.35 U/mL; 95% CI, 0.16-0.53 U/mL; P <.001) and phosphorylated mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) (0.22 AU; 95% CI, 0.04-0.40 AU; P =.02). Improvements in Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part 3 off-medication scores were associated with levels of total mTOR (F4,50 = 5.343, P =.001) and phosphorylated mTOR (F4,50 = 4.384, P =.04). Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this study are consistent with target engagement of brain insulin, Akt, and mTOR signaling pathways by exenatide and provide a mechanistic context for the clinical findings of the Exenatide-PD trial.

Vitamin D status and intakes are thought to be inversely associated with BC occurrence. Objectives: In our systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated evidence linking serum 25(OH)D (both in serum and diet) with breast cancer (BC) occurrence. Data sources and extraction: Only observational studies from databases such as PubMed and Cochrane (January 1st 2000 through March 15th, 2018) were included using PRISMA guidelines. Publication bias and consistency upon replication were assessed, while harmonizing risk ratios (RR, 95% CI) of BC, per fixed increment of 5 exposures [10 ng/mL of 25(OH)D; 100 IU/d for total/dietary vitamin D intakes; vitamin D deficiency; supplement use). RRs were pooled using random effect models. Data analysis: Pooled findings from 22 studies suggested a net direct association between 25(OH)D deficiency and BC, with RR pooled = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.51–2.41, P < 0.001). Total vitamin D intake (RR pooled = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.97–1.00, P = 0.022, per 100 IU/d) and supplemental vitamin D (RR pooled = 0.97, 95% CI:0.95–1.00, P = 0.026) were inversely associated with BC. No evidence of publication bias was found; all 5 exposures of interest were consistent upon replication.

Importantly, there is overlap between monogenic and sporadic PD genes, particularly for the loci that contain the genes SNCA and LRRK2, which are mutated in monogenic dominant PD. There have also been reports of idiopathic PD cases with heterozygous variants in autosomal recessive genes suggesting that these mutations may increase risk of PD.

In this study, we propose a fully automated, data-driven image segmentation platform that addresses multiple difficulties in segmenting MR images such as varying inhomogeneity, non-standardness, and noise, while producing a high-quality definition of different tissues. In contrast to most approaches in the literature, we perform segmentation operation by combining three different MRI contrasts and a novel segmentation tool, which takes into account variability in the data. The proposed system, based on a novel affinity definition within the fuzzy connectivity image segmentation family, prevents the need for user intervention and reparametrization of the segmentation algorithms. In order to make the whole system fully automated, we adapt an affinity propagation clustering algorithm to roughly identify tissue regions and image background. We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed algorithm's individual steps as well as comparison with several approaches from the literature for the main application of muscle/fat separation.

Neurexins, NRXN1, NRXN2, and NRXN3, are presynaptic adhesion molecules that specify neuron synapses and regulate neurotransmitter release. Neurexins and postsynaptic neuroligins interact with amyloid beta oligomer (AβO) deposits in damaged synapses. NRXN3 gene variants have been associated with autism, addiction, and schizophrenia, however, not fully investigated in Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, we investigated an AD association of a 3′-splicing allele of rs8019381 that produces altered expression of transmembrane or soluble NRXN3 isoforms. Methods: We carried out RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), PCR-RFLP (PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism), Sanger sequencing, and in situ hybridization (ISH) assays for NRXN3 neuron expression and genotyping. Genetic associations were analyzed by χ 2 tests, and ISH signals were analyzed by FISH v1.0 module of Indica Labs HALO software. Results: We previously identified a functional haplotype in the 3′ region of neurexin 3 (NRXN3) gene that alters the expression ratios between NRXN3 transmembrane and soluble isoforms. In this study, we found that expression and ratio of transmembrane and soluble NRXN3 isoforms were reduced in AD postmortem brains and inversely correlated with inflammasome component NLRP3 in AD brain regions. The splicing haplotype related to the transmembrane and soluble NRXN3 expression was associated with AD samples with P = 6.3 × 10-5 (odds ratio = 2.48) and interacted with APOE genotypes.

Methods Participants of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (n = 680, 50% male, aged 27-94 years) completed a clinical assessment and wore an Actiheart accelerometer. Transitions between active and sedentary states were modeled as a probability (Active-to-Sedentary Transition Probability [ASTP]) defined as the reciprocal of the average PA bout duration.

Methods: In this community-based, cross-sectional study, euthyroid participants of the Invecchiare in Chianti study, aged 23–102 years (N = 1060), were considered. Physical performance was evaluated by the Summary Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score. Plasma TSH, FT3, and FT4 levels were predictors, and SPPB score was the outcome. Results: At the univariate analyses, TSH, FT4, and FT3 were not significantly associated with SPPB score in young individuals, whereas, in older participants, SBBP score was positively (P < 0.001) associated with FT3, and negatively associated with both TSH (P < 0.02) and FT4 (P < 0.001). After adjusting for multiple confounders, FT3 remained significantly associated with SPPB (beta ± SE, 0.35 ± 0.17, P = 0.04), but FT4 and TSH were not. Results did not change when all the three hormones FT3, FT4, and TSH were simultaneously considered in the fully adjusted model (beta ± SE for FT3, 0.37 ± 0.18, P = 0.04). Discussion: The results of this study demonstrate that SPPB score is positively associated with circulating FT3 but not with FT4 or with TSH, in older euthyroid individuals.

To understand how estrogen and other nuclear hormones influence antibody production, we characterized total serum antibody isotypes in female and male mice of C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ and C3H/HeJ mouse strains. Antibody levels were higher in females compared to males in all strains and there was a female preference for IgG2b production. Sex-biased patterns were influenced by vitamin levels, and by antigen specificity toward influenza virus or pneumococcus antigens. To help explain sex biases, we examined the direct effects of estrogen on immunoglobulin heavy chain sterile transcript production among purified, lipopolysaccharide-stimulated B cells. Supplemental estrogen in B-cell cultures significantly increased immunoglobulin heavy chain sterile transcripts. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses of activated B cells identified significant ERα binding to estrogen response elements (EREs) centered within enhancer elements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, including the Eµ enhancer and hypersensitive site 1,2 (HS1,2) in the 3′ regulatory region. The ERE in HS1,2 was conserved across animal species, and in humans marked a site of polymorphism associated with the estrogen-augmented autoimmune disease, lupus.

We examined the sensitivity and specificity of different CKD awareness questions among diverse community-dwelling adults who were not necessarily engaged in primary care to determine the generalizability of prior results. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting & Participants: Participants in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS)Study. Predictor: CKD awareness, ascertained using 5 different questions. Outcome: Sensitivity and specificity of each awareness question, using laboratory results as the gold standard. Analytic Approach: Logistic regression was used to compare sensitivities of different awareness questions. Results: Among 2,046 participants, mean (SD)age was 56.5 (9.1)years, 41.5% were men, and 61.3% were African American. More than 40% were poor, 35% reported not having health insurance, and 16.9% had low health literacy. More than 20% (n = 424)had CKD. Sensitivities of single CKD awareness questions ranged from 2.2% for “kidney damage” to 5.2% for “kidney problem.” Sensitivity of the compound question asking about “weak kidneys, failing kidneys, or kidney disease” was 19.5%. Sensitivity of this compound CKD awareness question was higher among study participants with more advanced CKD and low health literacy, and those who lived below the poverty level. Limitations: Single measures of estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria; study participants may have been more engaged in their health care than the average US adult, potentially limiting the generalizability of results. Conclusions: CKD awareness is low among community-dwelling adults with kidney disease, though data using a sensitive compound question ascertaining awareness suggest that we have met the Healthy People 2020 goal related to CKD awareness of 13.4%.

Objectives We explored whether the amount and type (animal or vegetable) of protein intake were associated with 5-y change in mid-thigh muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) in older adults (n = 1561). Methods Protein intake was assessed at year 2 by a Block food-frequency questionnaire in participants (aged 70-79 y) of the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study, a prospective cohort study. At year 1 and year 6 mid-thigh muscle CSA in square centimeters was measured by computed tomography.

Consistent with an inherent susceptibility to RS, we show that human ALT telomeres are highly enriched for macroH2A1.2. However, in contrast to ATRX-proficient cells, ALT telomeres transiently lose macroH2A1.2 during acute RS to facilitate DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation, a process that is almost completely prevented by ectopic ATRX expression. Telomeric macroH2A1.2 is re-deposited in a DNA damage response (DDR)-dependent manner to promote homologous recombination-associated ALT pathways.

In this study, the authors investigate the relationship between peripheral sensory systems (vestibular and proprioception) and performance on the FOEC test in a cohort of healthy adults. Design: A total of 563 community-dwelling healthy adults (mean age, 72.7 [SD, 12.6] years; range, 27 to 93 years) participating in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging were tested. Proprioceptive threshold (PROP) was evaluated with passive motion detection at the right ankle. Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain was measured using video head impulses.

Participants stood on FOEC for 40 sec while wearing BalanSens (BioSensics, LLC, Watertown, MA) to quantify center of mass sway area. A mixed-model multiple logistic regression was used to examine the odds of passing the FOEC test based on PROP, VOR, cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potential, and ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potential function in a multisensory model while controlling for age and gender. Results: The odds of passing the FOEC test decreased by 15% (p < 0.001) for each year of increasing age and by 8% with every 0.1 reduction in VOR gain (p = 0.025). Neither PROP nor otolith function was significantly associated with passing the FOEC test. Conclusions: Failure to maintain balance during FOEC may serve as a proxy for rotational vestibular contributions to postural control.

We used a ligation-mediated PCR assay to detect single-strand breaks and double-strand breaks that were either staggered or blunt. In contrast to switch regions, V regions contained predominantly single-strand breaks, which peaked 10 d after immunization. We then examined the pathways used to generate these breaks in UNG- and MSH6-deficient mice. Surprisingly, both DNA repair pathways contributed substantially to break formation, and in the absence of both UNG and MSH6, the frequency of breaks was severely reduced. When the breaks were sequenced and mapped, they were widely distributed over a 1000-bp intron region downstream of J H 3 and J H 4 exons and were unexpectedly located at all 4 nt. These data suggest that during DNA repair, nicks are generated at distal sites from the original deaminated cytosine, and these repair intermediates could generate both faithful and mutagenic repair. During mutagenesis, single-strand breaks would allow entry for low-fidelity DNA polymerases to generate somatic hypermutation.",6,30665938,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,NA,21275,NIH,ZIAAG000732,National Institutes of Health,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,352,NA,NA

Obesity impairs cognition and increases the risk for some psychiatric disorders and dementias. Moreover, maternal and paternal obesity predispose offspring to poor cognitive outcomes by epigenetic molecular mechanisms.

Ca 2+ signaling controls the heartbeat rate—directly, through the effect on membrane molecules (NCX exchange, K + channel), and indirectly, through activation of calmodulin-AC-cAMP-PKA signaling. Thus, the physiological role of signaling in pacemaker cells can only be assessed if the Ca 2+ dynamics are in the physiological range. Cultured cells that can be genetically manipulated and/or virally infected with probes are required for this purpose. Because rabbit pacemaker cells in culture experience a decrease in their spontaneous action potential (AP) firing rate below the physiological range, Ca 2+ dynamics are expected to be affected. However, Ca 2+ dynamics in cultured pacemaker cells have not been reported before. We aim to a develop a modified culture method that sustains the global and local Ca 2+ kinetics along with the AP firing rate of rabbit pacemaker cells. We used experimental and computational tools to test the viability of rabbit pacemaker cells in culture under various conditions. We tested the effect of culture dish coating, pH, phosphorylation, and energy balance on cultured rabbit pacemaker cells function. The cells were maintained in culture for 48 h in two types of culture media: one without the addition of a contraction uncoupler and one enriched with either 10 mM BDM (2,3-Butanedione 2-monoxime) or 25 μM blebbistatin. The uncoupler was washed out from the medium prior to the experiments. Cells were successfully infected with a GFP adenovirus cultured with either BDM or blebbistatin. Using either uncoupler during culture led to the cell surface area being maintained at the same level as fresh cells. Moreover, the phospholamban and ryanodine receptor densities and their phosphorylation level remained intact in culture when either blebbistatin or BDM were present. Spontaneous AP firing rate, spontaneous Ca 2+ kinetics, and spontaneous local Ca 2+ release parameters were similar in the cultured cells with blebbistatin as in fresh cells. However, BDM affects these parameters. Using experimental and a computational model, we showed that by eliminating contraction, phosphorylation activity is preserved and energy is reduced.

On the one hand, diseases belonging to common patterns of multimorbidity may interact, curtailing compensatory mechanisms and resulting in physical and cognitive decline. On the other hand, physical and cognitive impairment impact the severity and burden of multimorbidity, contributing to the establishment of a vicious circle. The circle may be further exacerbated by people's reduced ability to cope with treatment and care burden and physicians’ fragmented view of health problems, which cause suboptimal use of health services and reduced quality of life and survival. Thus, the synergistic effects of medical diagnoses and functional status in adults, particularly older adults, emerge as central to assessing their health and care needs. Furthermore, common pathways seem to underlie multimorbidity, functional impairment and their interplay. For example, older age, obesity, involuntary weight loss and sedentarism can accelerate damage accumulation in organs and physiological systems by fostering inflammatory status. Inappropriate use or overuse of specific medications and drug–drug and drug–disease interactions also contribute to the bidirectional association between multimorbidity and functional impairment. Additionally, psychosocial factors such as low socioeconomic status and the direct or indirect effects of negative life events, weak social networks and an external locus of control may underlie the complex interactions between multimorbidity, functional decline and negative outcomes.

A possible explanation is that state-of-the-art quasi-static models do not estimate patient-specific loads. A novel FE modeling technique was developed to improve the biofidelity of simulated impact loading from sideways falling. This included surrogate models of the pelvis, lower extremities, and soft tissue that were morphed based on subject anthropometrics. Hip fracture prediction models based on aBMD and FE measurements were compared in a retrospective study of 254 elderly female subjects from the AGES-Reykjavik study. Subject fragility ratio (FR) was defined as the ratio between the ultimate forces of paired biofidelic models, one with linear elastic and the other with non-linear stress-strain relationships in the proximal femur. The expected end-point value (EEV) was defined as the FR weighted by the probability of one sideways fall over five years, based on self-reported fall frequency at baseline. The change in maximum volumetric strain (ΔMVS) on the surface of the femoral neck was calculated between time of ultimate femur force and 90% post-ultimate force in order to assess the extent of tensile tissue damage present in non-linear models. After age-adjusted logistic regression, the area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) was highest for ΔMVS (0.72), followed by FR (0.71), aBMD (0.70), and EEV (0.67), however the differences between FEA and aBMD based prediction models were not deemed statistically significant. When subjects with no history of falling were excluded from the analysis, thus artificially assuming that falls were known a priori with no uncertainty, a statistically significant difference in AUC was detected between ΔMVS (0.85), and aBMD (0.74). Multivariable linear regression suggested that the variance in maximum elastic femur force was best explained by femoral head radius, pelvis width, and soft tissue thickness (R2 = 0.79; RMSE = 0.46 kN; p < 0.005). Weighting the hip fracture prediction models based on self-reported fall frequency did not improve the models’ sensitivity, however excluding non-fallers lead to significant differences between aBMD and FE based models.

In this study, we found no evidence of peripherally enriched rodent CB1 isoforms; however, some mCB1R isoforms are absent in peripheral tissues. We show that the mouse Cnr1 gene contains six exons that are transcribed from a single promoter. We found that mCB1A is a spliced variant of extended exon 1 and protein-coding exon 6; mCB1B is a novel spliced variant containing unspliced exon 1, intron 1, and exon 2, which is then spliced to exon 6; and mCB1C is a spliced variant including all 6 exons. Using RNAscope in situ hybridization, we show that the isoforms mCB1A and mCB1B are expressed at a cellular level and colocalized in GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus and cortex. RT-qPCR reveals that mCB1A and mCB1B are enriched in the brain, while mCB1B is not expressed in the pancreas or the liver. Rat rCB1R isoforms are differentially expressed in primary cultured neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. We also investigated modulation of Cnr1 expression by insulin in vivo and carried out in silico modeling of CB1R with JD5037, a peripherally restricted CB1R inverse agonist, using the published crystal structure of hCB1R.

Recently, growing evidence indicates the presence of functional CB 2 Rs in the brain. However, this finding is disputed because of the specificity of CB 2 R antibody signals. We used two strains of currently available partial CB 2 -knockout (CB 2 -KO) mice as controls, four anti-rat or anti-mouse CB 2 R antibodies, and mRNA quantification to further address this issue. Western blot assays using the four antibodies detected a CB 2 R-like band at ~40 kD in both the brain and spleen. Notably, more bands were detected in the brain than in the spleen, and specific immune peptides blocked band detection. Immunohistochemical assays also detected CB 2 -like immunostaining in mouse midbrain dopamine neurons. CB 2 R deletion in CB 2 -KO mice may reduce or leave CB 2 R-like immunoreactivity unaltered depending on antibody epitope. Antibodies with epitopes at the receptor-deleted region detected a significant reduction in CB 2 R band density and immunostaining in N-terminal-deleted Deltagen and C-terminal-deleted Zimmer strain CB 2 -KO mice. Other antibodies with epitopes at the predicted receptor-undeleted regions detected similar band densities and immunostaining in wild-type and CB 2 -KO mice. Quantitative RT-PCR assays detected CB 2 mRNA expression using probes that targeted upstream or downstream gene sequences but not the probe that targeted the gene-deleted sequence in Deltagen or Zimmer CB 2 -KO mice. These findings suggest that none of the tested four polyclonal antibodies are highly mouse CB 2 R-specific. Non-specific binding may be related to the expression of mutant or truncated CB 2 R-like proteins in partial CB 2 -KO mice and the use of anti-rat CB 2 antibodies because the epitopes are different between rat and mouse CB 2 Rs.",42,29967455,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,cannabinoid | CB   gene  2 | CB   receptor antibody  2 | CB   receptors  2 | CB   -KO mice  2 | midbrain dopamine neurons | specific immune peptides | specificity | spleen,19403,NIH,K02DA000389,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,367,NA,NA

In Northern-European ancestry populations, HFE gene C282Y mutations are relatively common (0.3%-0.6% rare homozygote prevalence) and associated with excessive iron absorption, fatigue, diabetes, arthritis, and liver disease, especially in men. Iron excess can be prevented or treated but diagnosis is often delayed or missed. Data on sarcopenia, pain, and frailty are scarce. Methods: Using 200,975 UK Biobank volunteers aged 60-70 years, we tested associations between C282Y homozygosity with Fried frailty, sarcopenia, and chronic pain using logistic regression adjusted for age and technical genetic covariates. As iron overload is progressive (with menstruation protective), we included specific analyses of older (65-70 years) females and males. Results: One thousand three hundred and twelve (0.65%) participants were C282Y homozygotes; 593 were men (0.62%) and 719 were women (0.68%).

Multiple regression analyses examined independent and interactive associations of SES, age, and race with FA of the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes bilaterally. Sensitivity analyses assessed the influence of several biopsychosocial risk factors on these associations. Exploratory analyses examined these relations with trace and using additional SES indicators. Results indicated there were no significant interactions of SES, age, and race for any region.

No main effects were found for race in FA, and Whites had higher trace values in the parietal lobes.

Over the last 25 years since the discovery of the first linkage of genetic mutations to FA, its molecular genetic landscape has expanded tremendously as it became apparent that FA is a disease characterized by a defect in a specific DNA repair pathway responsible for the correction of covalent cross-links between the two complementary strands of the DNA double helix. This pathway has become increasingly complex, with the discovery of now over 20 FA-linked genes implicated in interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair. Moreover, gene products known to be involved in double-strand break (DSB) repair, mismatch repair (MMR), and nucleotide excision repair (NER) play roles in the ICL response and repair of associated DNA damage. While ICL repair is predominantly coupled with DNA replication, it also can occur in non-replicating cells. DNA damage accumulation and hematopoietic stem cell failure are thought to contribute to the increased inflammation and oxidative stress prevalent in FA. Adding to its confounding nature, certain FA gene products are also engaged in the response to replication stress, caused endogenously or by agents other than ICL-inducing drugs.

Thirty-seven institutionalized elders (84.05 ± 5.58 years) clinically diagnosed with AD (mild and moderate stages) were divided into two groups: Experimental Group (EG, n = 19) and Control Group (CG, n = 18). The EG participated in a six-month supervised MT program (aerobic, muscular resistance, flexibility and postural exercises) of 45–55 minutes/session, twice/week. Cognitive function (MMSE), physical fitness (Senior Fitness Test) and anthropometric variables (Body Mass Index and Waist Circumference), were assessed before (M1), after three months (M2) and after six months (M3) of the experimental protocol. A two-way ANOVA, with repeated measures, revealed significant group and time interactions on cognitive function, chair stand, arm curl, 2-min step, 8-foot up-and-go (UG), chair sit-and-reach (CSR) and back scratch tests as well as waist circumference. Accordingly, for those variables a different response in each group was evident over the time, supported by a significantly better EG performance in chair stand, arm curl, 2-min step, UG, CSR and back scratch tests from M1 to M3, and a significant increase in MMSE from M1 to M2. The CG’s performance decreased over time (M1 to M3) in chair stand, arm curl, 2-min step, UG, CSR, back scratch and MMSE.

A preliminary analysis from the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study suggested that heptachlor epoxide, a metabolite from an organochlorine pesticide extensively used in Hawaii, may be especially important. This was a cross sectional analysis to evaluate the association of heptachlor epoxide and other organochlorine compounds with Lewy pathology in an expanded survey of brain organochlorine residues from the longitudinal Honolulu-Asia Aging Study. Methods: Organochlorines were measured in frozen occipital or temporal lobes in 705 brains using gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. Lewy pathology was identified using hematoxylin and eosin- and α-synuclein immunochemistry-stained sections from multiple brain regions. Results: The prevalence of Lewy pathology was nearly doubled in the presence versus the absence of heptachlor epoxide (30.1% versus 16.3%, P < 0.001). Although associations with other compounds were weaker, hexachlorobenzene (P = 0.003) and α-chlordane (P = 0.007) were also related to Lewy pathology. Most of the latter associations, however, were a result of confounding from heptachlor epoxide. Neither compound was significantly related to Lewy pathology after adjustment for heptachlor epoxide. In contrast, the association of heptachlor epoxide with Lewy pathology remained significant after adjustments for hexachlorobenzene (P = 0.013) or α-chlordane (P = 0.005). Findings were unchanged after removal of cases of PD and adjustment for age and other characteristics.

Intriguingly, recent studies have demonstrated an association between high IGFBP-2 concentrations and increased mortality not only in populations with certain types of cancer, but also in relatively healthy populations. We evaluated the role of IGFBP-2 in relation to BMI and mortality. Design and Participants: BMI, insulin sensitivity, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) and IGFBP-2 were assessed repeatedly in 539 participants of the Baltimore Longitudinal St udy of Aging around the ages of 55, 65 and 75 years. Results: IGFBP-2 concentrations positively correlated with insulin sensitivity and inversely with BMI, both at baseline and follow-up. Independent of IGF-I, sex, BMI and insulin sensitivity, circulating IGFBP-2 levels positively correlated with age (P < 0.001). Changes over time in BMI were associated with an inver se correlation in IGFBP-2 concentrations. Furthermore, we found indications of a relationship between low baseline IGFBP-2 levels and mortality. Remarkably, after adjustment for insulin sensitivity, the opposite association was found, as a unit increase of log(IGFBP2) was associated with an increase in the log hazard by 1.43 (95% CI: 0.3-2.6). This accounted for both baseline (P = 0.02) as well as serial (P < 0.001) measurements of IGFBP2. Finally, in this longitudinal st udy, we found that IGF-I concentrations increased with age (0.82 ± 0.2 (μg/L)/year, P < 0.001). Conclusion: This is the first study investigating the relationship between IGFBP-2 levels and age in a longitudinal setting. Serum IGFBP-2 levels increase with age after the age of 50 year s and evolve in parallel with insulin sensitivity. IGFBP-2 may therefore be a potential marker for insulin sensitivity. We further show that IGFBP-2 levels can predict mortality in this aging population. However, its predictive value for mortality can only be interpreted in relation to insulin sensitivity.

With aging, vestibular function declines and gait speed decreases. Vestibular loss contributes to decreasing gait speed, but this influence could be linked to spatial and/or temporal aspects of gait.

Methods: 113 community-dwelling healthy adults (mean age 72.2 (14.6) years) participating in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging were tested. Horizontal semicircular canal (SCC) function was evaluated using quantitative vestibulo-ocular reflex gain. Otolith function was measured with cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials. Gait kinematics were collected during normal speed walking. Multiple linear regressions examined the association between spatial and temporal gait parameters and SCC and otolith function separately, controlling for age, gender, height, and either cadence (for spatial gait outcomes) or stride length (for temporal gait outcomes) to account for gait speed effects. Results: Vestibular SCC function was significantly associated with both spatial and temporal gait parameters. Every 0.1 decrease in SCC function resulted in longer stride length (β = -.04 m, p = 0.004), longer stance time (β = 15.8 ms, p < 0.003), and a slower cadence (β = -2.1 steps/minute, p < 0.001).

We examined the relative validity of forty-three nutrients and twenty-seven food groups estimated by a brief-type self-administered diet history questionnaire (BDHQ) targeting very old Japanese, using semi-weighed dietary records (DR) as a reference.Design Between June and August 2012 and between June 2015 and February 2016, a three-day non-consecutive DR (at two-week intervals) and a BDHQ were completed.Setting Tokyo, the capital prefecture of Japan.Subjects Eighty very old Japanese (thirty-six men and forty-four women) aged 82-94 years.Results The median intakes of 40-70 % of the crude and energy-adjusted nutrients estimated by the BDHQ were significantly different from those estimated by the DR. The median Spearman's correlation coefficient of nutrient intakes between the BDHQ and the DR was 0·39-0·46. About half (48-56 %) of the food groups were significantly different in terms of the median intakes estimated by the BDHQ and the DR in crude and energy-adjusted values. The median Spearman's correlation coefficient between the BDHQ and the DR was 0·45-0·48.Conclusions Acceptable Spearman's correlations (≥0·3) were obtained for many dietary intakes among the very old Japanese population.

All studies performed linear regression analysis using an additive genetic model and associated ≈35 million imputed variants with natural log-transformed phenotype levels. In vitro gene silencing in cultured endothelial cells was performed for candidate genes to provide additional evidence on association and function.

Recent practice guidelines on male androgen deficiency recommend that testosterone be measured in the morning while fasting. Although there is ample evidence regarding morning measurement of testosterone, studies that evaluated the effect of glucose load or meals were limited by inclusion of hypogonadal or diabetic men, and measurement of testosterone was not performed using mass spectrometry. Methods: Sixty men (23–97 years) without pre-diabetes or diabetes who had normal total testosterone (TT) levels underwent either an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) after an overnight fast. Serum samples were collected before and at regular intervals for 2 h (OGTT cohort) or 3 h (MMTT cohort). TT was measured by LC-MS/MS. LH and prolactin were also measured. Results: TT decreased after a glucose load (mean drop at nadir = 100 ng/dL) and after a mixed meal (drop at nadir = 123 ng/dL). Approximately 11% of men undergoing OGTT and 56% undergoing MMTT experienced a transient decrease in TT below 300 ng/dL, the lower normal limit. Testosterone started declining 20 min into the tests, with average maximum decline at 60 min. Most men still had TT lower than baseline at 120 min.

LA is known to induce obesity and insulin resistance. In this study, two concentrations of LA with or without added glucose (G) were fed to mice to investigate their effects on endocannabinoid (EC) biology. Materials and Methods: Four groups of C57BL/6 mice were provided with diets containing 1% or 8% LA with or without added G (LAG) for 8 weeks. Body weights, food intake, circulating glucose and insulin levels were measured throughout the study. Following euthanasia, plasma, bowel and hepatic ECs, monoacylglycerol lipase and fatty acid amide hydroxylase protein levels (enzymes responsible for EC degradation) and transcriptional activity of PPARα in liver were quantified. Liver was probed for evidence of insulin receptor activity perturbation. Results: Increasing dietary LA from 1% to 8% significantly increased circulating, small bowel and hepatic ECs. 1%LAG fed mice had lowest feed efficiency, and only liver levels of both ECs were reduced by addition of G. Addition of G to 1% LA diets resulted in elevated monoacylglycerol lipase and fatty acid amide hydroxylase protein levels (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively) in liver due to increased transcriptional activity of PPARα (p < 0.05). The reduced EC levels with addition of G also correlated with a measure of enhanced insulin action. Conclusion: In conclusion, body weight of mice is influenced by the source of calorie intake. Furthermore, tissue EC/g are dependent on tissue-specific synthesis and degradation that are modulated by dietary LA and G which also influence food efficiency, and down-stream insulin signalling pathways.

Of relevance, it is noteworthy that cross-seeding (CS) of APs has recently been characterized in cellular and animal models of neurodegenerative disease, and that normal physiological CS of multiple APs has also been observed in lower organisms, including yeast and bacteria. In this context, our main objective is to discuss a possible involvement of the CS of APs in promoting evolvability, a hypothetical view regarding the function of APs as an inheritance of acquired characteristics against human brain stressors, which are transgenerationally transmitted to offspring via germ cells. Mechanistically, the protofibrils formed by the CS of multiple APs might confer hormesis more potently than individual APs. By virtue of greater encoded stress information in parental brains being available, the brains of offspring can cope more efficiently with forth-coming stressors. On the other hand, subsequent neurodegeneration caused by APs in parental brain through the antagonistic pleiotropy mechanism in aging, may suggest that synergistically, multiple APs might be more detrimental compared to singular AP in neurodegeneration. Taken together, we suggest that the CS of multiple APs might be involved in both evolvability and neurodegenerative disease in human brain, which may be mechanistically and therapeutically important.",10,31524179,Journal,ar,Article,100,8,8,Alzheimer's disease | amyloid cascade hypothesis | amyloidogenic proteins | antimicrobial protection model | cross-seeding | evolvability hypothesis | Parkinson's disease,19900191888,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,419,NA,NA

Leukocyte DNAmTL is applicable across the entire age spectrum and is more strongly associated with age than measured leukocyte TL (LTL) (r ~-0.75 for DNAmTL versus r ~ -0.35 for LTL). Leukocyte DNAmTL outperforms LTL in predicting: i) time-to-death (p=2.5E-20), ii) time-to-coronary heart disease (p=6.6E-5), iii) time-to-congestive heart failure (p=3.5E-6), and iv) association with smoking history (p=1.21E-17). These associations are further validated in large scale methylation data (n=10k samples) from the Framingham Heart Study, Women's Health Initiative, Jackson Heart Study, InChianti, Lothian Birth Cohorts, Twins UK, and Bogalusa Heart Study. Leukocyte DNAmTL is also associated with measures of physical fitness/functioning (p=0.029), age-at-menopause (p=0.039), dietary variables (omega 3, fish, vegetable intake), educational attainment (p=3.3E-8) and income (p=3.1E-5).

Immunohistochemical measurements revealed that the levels of the mitochondrial fusion-mediating protein, MFN1, were higher, whereas those of corresponding fission-regulating protein, DRP-1, were lower in the hippocampus of ApoE4 mice than in the corresponding ApoE3 mice, indicating that APOE4 is associated with increased mitochondrial fusion and decreased fission. A similar ApoE4-driven decrease in DRP-1 was also observed in AD brains. The levels of the mitochondrial proteins COX1 and Tom40, were higher in the ApoE4 mice, which is consistent with the increased fusion. Measurements of the levels of cleaved PINK1 and parkin, which mark and target mitochondria for mitophagic degradation, revealed lower levels of cleaved PINK1, suggesting reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and higher levels of parkin in the hippocampus of ApoE4 compared with the ApoE3 mice, indicating altered mitophagy. The levels of the ubiquitin-binding scaffold protein, p62/SQSTM1, which directs selected cargo to the autophagosomes, were also higher in the ApoE4 mice. These findings suggest that APOE4 is associated with enhanced mitochondrial fusion and decreased fission. Additionally, the results indicate that mitophagy/autophagy is reduced in ApoE4 mice, resulting in higher levels of proteins such as parkin and p62, which are normally degraded during this process.

First, does our increased understanding of mechanisms accounting for the long-term effects of early life adversities help delineate underlying dimensions that underscore key similarities and differences among these adversities? Second, can adults accurately report on adversities they experienced in childhood? Third, can we identify malleable risk processes in adulthood that might be targets for preventive intervention? Supported by the National Institute on Aging, the U.K. Economic and Social and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Councils, a network of researchers in human and animal development addressed these questions through meetings and literature review. A small number of dimensions may adequately distinguish among a range of co-occurring childhood adversities.

However, the mechanisms by which APOE4 affects the brain, underpinning this risk, have not been fully elucidated. Purpose: To investigate the influence of APOE4 on global cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and possible mediation through amyloid burden by using MRI-based brain oxygen extraction technique. Materials and Methods: Participants were enrolled from a longitudinal prospective study, the Biomarkers for Older Controls at Risk for Dementia study (data collected from January 2015 to December 2017), of whom 35% (50 of 143 participants) were APOE4 carriers. OEF was measured by using a T2-relaxation-under-spin-tagging MRI technique with a 3.0-T MRI system. PET acquired with carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh compound B tracer was available in 119 participants to measure amyloid burden. Cognitive performance was assessed by using domain-specific composite scores including executive function, episodic memory, visual-spatial processing, and language. Linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between APOE4, OEF, and amyloid burden.

Results: A total of 143 cognitively healthy individuals (mean age ± standard deviation, 69.1 years ± 8.2; 57 men and 86 women) were studied.

Furthermore, among APOE4 carriers, lower OEF correlated with lower executive function scores (b = 0.079 z score for each percent change in OEF; P = .03). Amyloid burden and OEF were independently associated with APOE4 but were not associated with one another, suggesting that the effect of APOE4 on OEF is not mediated by amyloid.

However, uncontrolled TNF signaling causes aberrant inflammation and has been implicated in several human ailments. Therefore, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying dynamical and gene controls of TNF signaling bear significance for human health. As such, TNF engages the canonical nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway to activate RelA:p50 heterodimers, which induce expression of specific immune response genes. Brief and chronic TNF stimulation produces transient and long-lasting NF-κB activities, respectively. Negative feedback regulators of the canonical pathway, including IκBα, are thought to ensure transient RelA:p50 responses to short-lived TNF signals. The non-canonical NF-κB pathway mediates RelB activity during immune differentiation involving p100. We uncovered an unexpected role of p100 in TNF signaling. Brief TNF stimulation of p100-deficient cells triggered an additional late NF-κB activity consisting of RelB:p50 heterodimers, which modified the TNF-induced gene-expression program. In p100-deficient cells subjected to brief TNF stimulation, RelB:p50 not only sustained the expression of a subset of RelA-target immune response genes but also activated additional genes that were not normally induced by TNF in WT mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and were related to immune differentiation and metabolic processes. Despite this RelB-mediated distinct gene control, however, RelA and RelB bound to mostly overlapping chromatin sites in p100-deficient cells.

Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that physical activity is associated with better oxidative capacity, independent of age. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study performed in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, conducted by the Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Institute on Aging (NIA). SETTING: NIA IRP Clinical Research Unit, Baltimore, MD. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 384 adults (54.7% women), aged 22 to 92 years, seen between 2013 and 2017. MEASUREMENTS: Muscle oxidative capacity was measured in vivo using phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We determined the postexercise time constant (τPCr; in seconds) for phosphocreatine (PCr) recovery, with lower values of τPCr, (ie, more rapid recovery of PCr levels after exercise) reflecting greater oxidative capacity. Time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was assessed using wearable accelerometers that participants wore 5.9 ± 0.9 consecutive days in the free-living environment. RESULTS: In linear regression models, higher τPCr was associated with older age (standardized β =.39; P <.001) after adjusting for sex, race, height, and weight. After including MVPA as an independent variable, the standardized regression coefficient of age decreased by 40%, but remained associated with τPCr (βage =.22; P <.001) and had a smaller standardized regression coefficient than MVPA (βMVPA = −.33; P <.001). After adjusting for health status, education, and smoking history, the standardized regression coefficient for age decreased 12% (βage =.20; P =.003), while the standardized coefficient for MVPA decreased only 3% (βMVPA = −.32; P <.001). CONCLUSION: Study findings suggest that MVPA is strongly associated with muscle oxidative capacity, independent of age, providing mechanistic insights into the health benefits of exercise in older age.

However, it remains unclear whether the loss of oxidative capacity is caused by reduced volume and function of mitochondria or limited substrate availability secondary to impaired muscle perfusion. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the role of muscle perfusion on the age-related decline of muscle oxidative capacity and ultimately whole-body aerobic capacity. Muscle oxidative capacity was assessed by 31P-MRS post-exercise phosphocreatine recovery time (τPCr), with higher τPCr reflecting lower oxidative capacity, in 75 healthy participants (48 men, 22-89 years) of the Genetic and Epigenetic Signatures of Translational Aging Laboratory Testing study. Muscle perfusion was characterized as an index of blood volume at rest using a customized diffusion-weighted MRI technique and analysis method developed in our laboratory. Aerobic capacity (peak-VO2) was also measured during a graded treadmill exercise test in the same visit. Muscle oxidative capacity, peak-VO2, and resting muscle perfusion were significantly lower at older ages independent of sex, race, and body mass index (BMI). τPCr was significantly associated with resting muscle perfusion independent of age, sex, race, and BMI (p-value = 0.004, β = -0.34). τPCr was also a significant independent predictor of peak-VO2 and, in a mediation analysis, significantly attenuated the association between muscle perfusion and peak-VO2 (34% reduction for β in perfusion). These findings suggest that the age-associated decline in muscle oxidative capacity is partly due to impaired muscle perfusion and not mitochondrial dysfunction alone. Furthermore, our findings show that part of the decline in whole-body aerobic capacity observed with aging is also due to reduced microvascular blood volume at rest, representing a basal capacity of the microvascular system, which is mediated by muscle oxidative capacity. This finding suggests potential benefit of interventions that target an overall increase in muscle perfusion for the restoration of energetic capacity and mitochondrial function with aging.",26,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,31 P MRS | Aging | Bioenergetic | Diffusion weighted MRI | Muscle perfusion | Peak-VO 2,21100215107,NIH,undefined,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,438,427,NA

Detailed evaluation of the ventricular system is important for these conditions to help understand the pathogenesis of ventricular enlargement and elucidate novel patterns of ventriculomegaly that can be associated with different diseases. One such disease is normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a chronic form of hydrocephalus in older adults that causes dementia. Automatic parcellation of the ventricular system into its sub-compartments in patients with ventriculomegaly is quite challenging due to the large variation of the ventricle shape and size. Conventional brain labeling methods are time-consuming and often fail to identify the boundaries of the enlarged ventricles. We propose a modified 3D U-Net method to perform accurate ventricular parcellation, even with grossly enlarged ventricles, from magnetic resonance images (MRIs). We validated our method on a data set of healthy controls as well as a cohort of 95 patients with NPH with mild to severe ventriculomegaly and compared with several state-of-the-art segmentation methods. On the healthy data set, the proposed network achieved mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.895 ± 0.03 for the ventricular system. On the NPH data set, we achieved mean DSC of 0.973 ± 0.02, which is significantly (p < 0.005) higher than four state-of-the-art segmentation methods we compared with. Furthermore, the typical processing time on CPU-base implementation of the proposed method is 2 min, which is much lower than the several hours required by the other methods. Results indicate that our method provides: 1) highly robust parcellation of the ventricular system that is comparable in accuracy to state-of-the-art methods on healthy controls; 2) greater robustness and significantly more accurate results on cases of ventricular enlargement; and 3) a tool that enables computation of novel imaging biomarkers for dilated ventricular spaces that characterize the ventricular system.",47,31174103,Journal,ar,Article,100,8,8,Convolutional neural networks | Enlarged brain ventricles | Labeling | Magnetic resonance imaging | Normal pressure hydrocephalus | Ventricular system,21100222534,NIH,R21-NS096497,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,441,101871,S2213158219302219

The success of this approach in cancer based on analyses of traditional and emerging body fluid-based biomarkers has given rise to the concept of liquid biopsy enabling a non-invasive and widely accessible precision medicine approach and a significant paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Serial liquid biopsies offer clues about the evolution of cancer in individual patients across disease stages enabling the application of individualized genetically and biologically guided therapies. Moreover, liquid biopsy is contributing to the transformation of drug research and development strategies as well as supporting clinical practice allowing identification of subsets of patients who may enter pathway-based targeted therapies not dictated by clinical phenotypes alone. A similar liquid biopsy concept is emerging for Alzheimer’s disease, in which blood-based biomarkers adaptable to each patient and stage of disease, may be used for positive and negative patient selection to facilitate establishment of high-value drug targets and counter-measures for drug resistance.

Here we quantify the contributions of these chemokine receptors to the migration and entry rate of Th1 cells into M. tuberculosis-infected lungs using competitive adoptive transfer migration assays and mathematical modeling. We found that in 8.6 h half of M. tuberculosisspecific CD4 T cells migrate from the blood to the lung parenchyma. CXCR3 deficiency decreases the average rate of Th1 cell entry into the lung parenchyma by half, while CX3CR1 deficiency doubles it. KLRG1 blockade has no effect on Th1 cell lung migration. CCR2, CXCR5, and, to a lesser degree, CCR5 and CXCR6 also promote the entry of Th1 cells into the lungs of infected mice. Moreover, blockade of G-protein-coupled receptors with pertussis toxin treatment prior to transfer only partially inhibits T cell migration into the lungs.

Although the interaction and mutual inhibition between glucose and fatty-acids (FAs) catabolism has been studied for decades, a quantitative and integrated understanding of the control and regulation of substrate selection through central catabolic pathways is lacking. We addressed this gap here using a computational model representing cardiomyocyte catabolism encompassing glucose (Glc) utilization, pyruvate transport into mitochondria and oxidation in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, β-oxidation of palmitate (Palm), oxidative phosphorylation, ion transport, pH regulation, and ROS generation and scavenging in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments. The model is described by 82 differential equations and 119 enzymatic, electron transport and substrate transport reactions accounting for regulatory mechanisms and key players, namely pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and its modulation by multiple effectors. We applied metabolic control analysis to the network operating with various Glc to Palm ratios. The flux and metabolites' concentration control were visualized through heat maps providing major insights into main control and regulatory nodes throughout the catabolic network. Metabolic pathways located in different compartments were found to reciprocally control each other. For example, glucose uptake and the ATP demand exert control on most processes in catabolism while TCA cycle activities and membrane-associated energy transduction reactions exerted control on mitochondrial processes namely β-oxidation. PFK and PDH, two highly regulated enzymes, exhibit opposite behavior from a control perspective. While PFK activity was a main rate-controlling step affecting the whole network, PDH played the role of a major regulator showing high sensitivity (elasticity) to substrate availability and key activators/inhibitors, a trait expected from a flexible substrate selector strategically located in the metabolic network. PDH regulated the rate of Glc and Palm consumption, consistent with its high sensitivity toward AcCoA, CoA, and NADH. Overall, these results indicate that the control of catabolism is highly distributed across the metabolic network suggesting that fuel selection between FAs and Glc goes well beyond the mechanisms traditionally postulated to explain the glucose-fatty-acid cycle.",18,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Central catabolism | Computational modeling | Control coefficients | Glucose and fatty acids | Metabolic control analysis | Pyruvate dehydrogenase regulation,21100215107,NIH,undefined,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,444,201,NA

We observed a significant increase of somatic L1Hs insertions in the brain compared with non-brain tissues from the same individual.

In contrast, ketamine, when administered as a single subanesthetic dose, exerts rapid and sustained antidepressant actions. Preclinical studies indicate that the ketamine metabolite (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine [(2R,6R)-HNK] is a rapid-acting antidepressant drug candidate with limited dissociation properties and abuse potential. We assessed the role of group II metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes 2 (mGlu2) and 3 (mGlu3) in the antidepressant-relevant actions of (2R,6R)-HNK using behavioral, genetic, and pharmacological approaches as well as cortical quantitative EEG (qEEG) measurements in mice.

Although AD and SCZ partially overlap in terms of psychiatric symptoms and some aspects of cognitive impairment, the causal relationship between AD and SCZ is unclear. Based on the similarity of APs with yeast prion in terms of stress-induced protein aggregation, we recently proposed that evolvability of APs might be an epigenetic phenomenon to transmit stress information of parental brain to cope with the stressors in offspring. Although amyloid evolvability may be beneficial in evolution, AD might be manifested during parental aging as the mechanism of antagonistic pleiotropy phenomenon. Provided that accumulating evidence implicates stress as an important factor in SCZ, the main objective of this paper is to better understand the possible connection of AD and SCZ through amyloid evolvability. Hypothetically, the delivery of information of stress by APs may be less efficient under the decreased evolvability conditions such as disease-modifying treatment, leading to SCZ in offspring. Conversely, the increased evolvability conditions including gene mutations of APs are supposed to be beneficial for offspring, but might lead to AD in parents.

Olfactory dysfunction might unveil the association between ageing and frailty, as it is associated with declining cognitive function, depression, reduced physical performance, reduced dietary intake, and mortality; all these conditions are characterized by increased levels of inflammatory parameters.

We analysed data of 1035 participants aged 65+ enrolled in the ""InCHIANTI"" study. Olfactory function was tested by the recognition of the smells of coffee, mint, and air. Olfactory dysfunction was defined as lack of recognition of at least two smells. Considering the items ""shrinking,"" ""exhaustion,"" ""sedentariness,"" ""slowness,"" and ""weakness"" included in the Fried definition, frailty was defined as the presence of at least three criteria, prefrailty of one or two, and robustness of none.

Logistic regression was adopted to assess the association of frailty with olfactory function, as well as with the increasing number of olfactory deficits. Cox regression was used to test the association between olfactory dysfunction and 9-year survival. Results. Olfactory dysfunction was associated with frailty, after adjusting (OR 1.94, 95% CI=1.07-3.51; P=.028); analysis of the interaction term indicated that the association varied according to interleukin-6 levels (P for interaction=.005).

Objective: To examine individual and combined associations of cardiorespiratory fitness and obesity in male adolescents with later receipt of a disability pension due to all and specific causes. Design: Population-based cohort study. Setting: Sweden. Participants: 1 079 128 Swedish adolescents aged 16 to 19 years who were conscripted into the military between 1972 and 1994. Measurements: Cardiorespiratory fitness and body mass index (BMI) were measured at conscription and were related to information on later receipt of a disability pension obtained from the Social Insurance Agency. Results: Over a median follow-up of 28.3 years, 54 304 men were granted a disability pension. Low cardiorespiratory fitness was strongly associated with later receipt of a disability pension due to all causes (hazard ratio, 3.74 [95% CI, 3.55 to 3.95] for lowest vs. highest fitness decile) and specific causes (psychiatric, musculoskeletal, injuries, nervous system, circulatory, and tumors). Obesity was associated with greater risk for receipt of a disability pension due to all and specific causes, with the greatest risks observed for class II and III obesity. Compared with being unfit, being moderately or highly fit was associated with attenuated risk for receipt of a disability pension across BMI categories.

We present here, seven DNAm-based estimators of plasma proteins including those of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and growth differentiation factor 15. The resulting predictor of lifespan, DNAm GrimAge (in units of years), is a composite biomarker based on the seven DNAm surrogates and a DNAm-based estimator of smoking packyears. Adjusting DNAm GrimAge for chronological age generated novel measure of epigenetic age acceleration, AgeAccelGrim. Using large scale validation data from thousands of individuals, we demonstrate that DNAm GrimAge stands out among existing epigenetic clocks in terms of its predictive ability for time-to-death (Cox regression P=2.0E- 75), time-to-coronary heart disease (P=6.2E-24), time-to-cancer (P= 1.3E-12), its strong relationship with computed tomography data for fatty liver/excess visceral fat, and age-at-menopause (P=1.6E-12). AgeAccelGrim is strongly associated with a host of age-related conditions including comorbidity count (P=3.45E- 17). Similarly, age-adjusted DNAm PAI-1 levels are associated with lifespan (P=5.4E-28), comorbidity count (P= 7.3E-56) and type 2 diabetes (P=2.0E-26).

Main outcome measure Odds ratios and Cox hazard ratios of disease rates between participants with and without the haemochromatosis mutations, adjusted for age, genotyping array type, and genetic principal components. The sexes were analysed separately as morbidity due to iron excess occurs later in women.

However, widespread use of ketamine is limited by its side effects, abuse potential, and poor oral bioavailability. The ketamine metabolite, (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine, exerts rapid antidepressant effects, without ketamine’s adverse effects and abuse potential, in rodents. Methods: We evaluated the oral bioavailability of (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine in three species (mice, rats, and dogs) and also evaluated five candidate prodrug modifications for their capacity to enhance the oral bioavailability of (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine in mice. Oral administration of (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine was assessed for adverse behavioral effects and for antidepressant efficacy in the mouse forced-swim and learned helplessness tests. Results: (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine had absolute bioavailability between 46–52% in mice, 42% in rats, and 58% in dogs.

Small molecule inhibitors of DNA helicases can be used to induce synthetic lethality, which attempts to target helicase-dependent compensatory DNA repair pathways in tumor cells that are already genetically deficient in a specific pathway of DNA repair. Alternatively, helicase inhibitors may be useful as tools to study the specialized roles of helicases in replication and DNA repair. In this study, approximately 350,000 small molecules were screened based on their ability to inhibit duplex DNA unwinding by a catalytically active WRN helicase domain fragment in a high-throughput fluorometric assay to discover new non-covalent small molecule inhibitors of the WRN helicase. Select compounds were screened to exclude ones that inhibited DNA unwinding by other helicases in the screen, bound non-specifically to DNA, acted as irreversible inhibitors, or possessed unfavorable chemical properties.

The biological activity of these proteins may be affected by circulating antagonists such as their respective prodomains, follistatin (FST315), WFIKKN1, and WFIKKN2. Reports of the relationship of GDF8 and GDF11 and their antagonists with aging and aging phenotypes such as skeletal muscle strength have been conflicting possibly because of difficulties in measuring these proteins and polypeptides. Methods Plasma GDF8 and GDF11 and their antagonists were measured using a multiplexed selected reaction monitoring assay and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in 160 healthy adults aged 22-93 years. Quadriceps strength was measured by knee extensor torque using isokinetic dynamometry. Results Spearman correlations with age were the following: GDF11 prodomain (r =.30, p =.001), GDF11 mature protein (r =.23, p =.004), FST315 (r =.32, p <.0001), WFIKKN1 (r =-.21, p = 0.008), and WFIKKN2 (r =.18, p =.02).

Due to a paucity of longitudinal data, it is not known how Δ age (epigenetic age-chronological age) changes over time or if it remains constant from childhood to old age. Here, we investigate this using longitudinal DNA methylation data from five datasets, covering most of the human life course. Methods Two measures of the epigenetic clock (Hannum and Horvath) are used to calculate Δ age in the following cohorts: Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) offspring (n = 986, total age-range 7-19 years, 2 waves), ALSPAC mothers (n = 982, 16-60 years, 2 waves), InCHIANTI (n = 460, 21-100 years, 2 waves), SATSA (n = 373, 48-99 years, 5 waves), Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (n = 1,054, 70-76 years, 3 waves), and Lothian Birth Cohort 1921 (n = 476, 79-90 years, 3 waves). Linear mixed models were used to track longitudinal change in Δ age within each cohort. Results For both epigenetic age measures, Δ age showed a declining trend in almost all of the cohorts. The correlation between Δ age across waves ranged from 0.22 to 0.82 for Horvath and 0.25 to 0.71 for Hannum, with stronger associations in samples collected closer in time. Conclusions Epigenetic age increases at a slower rate than chronological age across the life course, especially in the oldest population.

Our findings revealed that typical development and aging are marked by significant shifts in the degree that networks preferentially coordinate with one another (i.e., modularity). Specifically, childhood showed higher modularity of networks compared to adolescence, reflecting a shift over development from segregation to desegregation of inter-network relationships. The shift from young to middle adulthood was marked by a significant decrease in inter-network modularity and organization, which continued into older adulthood, potentially reflecting changes in brain organizational efficiency with age. This study is the first to characterize brain development and aging in terms of inter-network structural covariance across the lifespan.",22,30368995,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,brain | brain development | lifespan aging | MRI | structural covariance | T1w,16101,NIH,P50HD052121,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,491,NA,NA

Our laboratory has focused on isolating the direct vs indirect effects of GH in preventing NAFLD/NASH. We reported that chow-fed, adult-onset, hepatocyte-specific, GH receptor knockdown (aHepGHRkd) mice rapidly (within 7 days) develop steatosis associated with increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL), independent of changes in systemic metabolic function. In this study, we report that 6 months after induction of aHepGHRkd early signs of NASH develop, which include hepatocyte ballooning, inflammation, signs of mild fibrosis, and elevated plasma alanine aminotransferase. These changes occur in the presence of enhanced systemic lipid utilization, without evidence of white adipose tissue lipolysis, indicating that the liver injury that develops after aHepGHRkd is due to hepatocyte-specific loss of GH signaling and not due to secondary defects in systemic metabolic function. Specifically, enhanced hepatic DNL is sustained with age in aHepGHRkd mice, associated with increased hepatic markers of lipid uptake/re-esterification. Because hepatic DNL is a hallmark of NAFLD/NASH, these studies suggest that enhancing hepatocyte GH signaling could represent an effective therapeutic target to reduce DNL and treat NASH.",16,30295789,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,NA,26061,NIH,K01DK115525,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,492,NA,NA

While MS-NLML provides excellent noise reduction and improved image feature preservation as compared to other NL or MS filters, it requires considerable processing time, limiting its application in routine analyses. In this work, we introduced a fast, simple, and robust filter, termed nonlocal estimation of multispectral magnitudes (NESMA), for noise reduction in multispectral (MS) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: Through extensive simulation and in-vivo analyses, we compared the performance of NESMA and MS-NLML in terms of noise reduction and processing efficiency. Further, we introduce two simple adaptive methods that permit spatial variation of similar voxels, R, used in the filtering. The first method is semi-adaptive and permits variation of R across the image by using a relative Euclidean distance (RED) similarity threshold. The second method is fully adaptive and filters the raw data with several RED similarity thresholds to spatially determine the optimal threshold value using an unbiased criterion. Results: NESMA shows very similar filtering performance as compared to MS-NLML, however, with much simple implementation and very fast processing time. Further, for both filters, the adaptive methods were shown to further reduce noise in comparison with the conventional non-adaptive method in which R is set to a constant value throughout the image. Conclusions: NESMA is fast, robust, and straightforward to implement filter. These features render it suitable for routine clinical use and analysis of large MRI datasets.",7,30149058,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,MRI | Multispectral filtering | Noise | Nonlocal maximum likelihood filter,17264,NIH,undefined,National Institutes of Health,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,493,NA,S0730725X18303035

In recent years, the G-quadruplex field has blossomed as new evidence strongly suggests that such alternately folded DNA structures are likely to exist in vivo. G4 DNA presents obstacles for the replication machinery, and both eukaryotic DNA helicases and polymerases have evolved to resolve and copy G4 DNA in vivo. In addition, G4-forming sequences are prevalent in gene promoters, suggesting that G4-resolving helicases act to modulate transcription.  Methods: We have searched the PubMed database to compile an up-to-date and comprehensive assessment of the field’s current knowledge to provide an overview of the molecular interactions of Gquadruplexes with DNA helicases and polymerases implicated in their resolution. Results: Novel computational tools and alternative strategies have emerged to detect G4-forming sequences and assess their biological consequences. Specialized DNA helicases and polymerases catalytically act upon G4-forming sequences to maintain normal replication and genomic stability as well as appropriate gene regulation and cellular homeostasis. G4 helicases also resolve telomeric repeats to maintain chromosomal DNA ends. Bypass of many G4-forming sequences is achieved by the action of translesion DNS polymerases or the PrimPol DNA polymerase. While the collective work has supported a role of G4 in nuclear DNA metabolism, an emerging field centers on G4 abundance in the mitochondrial genome. Conclusion: Discovery of small molecules that specifically bind and modulate DNA helicases and polymerases or interact with the G4 DNA structure itself may be useful for the development of anticancer regimes.",47,29149833,Journal,re,Review,100,4,4,G-quadruplex | G4 DNA | Helicase | Polymerase | PrimPol | Replication | Translesion synthesis,23488,NIH,ZIAAG000752,National Institutes of Health,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,494,NA,NA
