Similarly, innovations in research methodologies, standards of evidence, emergence of unique study cohorts, and breakthroughs in data analytics and modeling create new possibilities for producing biomedical knowledge and clinical translation. To understand these advances and inform future directions research, The Lifestyle Medicine Research Summit was convened at the University of Pittsburgh on December 4–5, 2019. The Summit's goal was to review current status and define research priorities in the six core areas of lifestyle medicine: plant-predominant nutrition, physical activity, sleep, stress, addictive behaviors, and positive psychology/social connection. Forty invited subject matter experts (1) reviewed existing knowledge and gaps relating lifestyle behaviors to common chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, many cancers, inflammatory- and immune-related disorders and other conditions; and (2) discussed the potential for applying cutting-edge molecular, cellular, epigenetic and emerging science knowledge and computational methodologies, research designs, and study cohorts to accelerate clinical applications across all six domains of lifestyle medicine. Notably, federal health agencies, such as the Department of Defense and Veterans Administration have begun to adopt “whole-person health and performance” models that address these lifestyle and environmental root causes of chronic disease and associated morbidity, mortality, and cost. Recommendations strongly support leveraging emerging research methodologies, systems biology, and computational modeling in order to accelerate effective clinical and population solutions to improve health and reduce societal costs. New and alternative hierarchies of evidence are also be needed in order to assess the quality of evidence and develop evidence-based guidelines on lifestyle medicine. Children and underserved populations were identified as prioritized groups to study.

Differential expression analysis revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the cortex long before observed onset of behavioral symptoms in this model. Using behavioral and biochemical data derived from the same mice and samples, we found that down but not up-regulated DEGs show a stronger average association with learning performance than random background genes in control not seen in AD mice. Conversely, these same genes were found to have a stronger association with Aβ deposition than background genes in AD but not in control mice, thereby identifying these genes as potential intermediaries between abnormal Aβ/NFT deposition and functional decline. Using a complementary approach, gene ontology analysis revealed a highly significant enrichment of learning and memory, associative, memory, and cognitive functions only among down-regulated, but not up-regulated, DEGs.

However, the precise mechanism by which inflammatory cytokines promote the formation and deposition of Aβ remains unclear. Available data suggest that applications of inflammatory cytokines onto isolated neurons do not promote the formation of Aβ, suggesting an indirect mechanism of action. Based on evidence astrocyte derived extracellular vesicles (astrocyte derived EVs) regulate neuronal functions, and data that inflammatory cytokines can modify the molecular cargo of astrocyte derived EVs, we sought to determine if IL-1β promotes the formation of Aβ indirectly through actions of astrocyte derived EVs on neurons. The production of Aβ was increased when neurons were exposed to astrocyte derived EVs shed in response to IL-1β (astrocyte derived EV-IL-1β). The mechanism for this effect involved an enrichment of Casein kinase 1 (CK1) in astrocyte derived EV-IL-1β. This astrocyte derived CK1 was delivered to neurons where it formed a complex with neuronal APC and GSK3 to inhibit the β-catenin degradation. Stabilized β-catenin translocated to the nucleus and bound to Hnrnpc gene at promoter regions. An increased cellular concentration of hnRNP C promoted the translation of APP by outcompeting the translational repressor fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) bound to APP mRNA. An increased amount of APP protein became co-localized with BACE1 in enlarged membrane microdomains concurrent with increased production of Aβ.

However, there is also evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction in CS, which likely contributes to the severe premature aging phenotype of this disease. While damaged mitochondria and impaired mitophagy were characterized in mice with CSB deficiency, such changes in the CS nematode model and CS patients are not fully known. Our cross-species transcriptomic analysis in CS postmortem brain tissue, CS mouse, and nematode models shows that mitochondrial dysfunction is indeed a common feature in CS. Restoration of mitochondrial dysfunction through NAD+ supplementation significantly improved lifespan and healthspan in the CS nematodes, highlighting mitochondrial dysfunction as a major driver of the aging features of CS. In cerebellar samples from CS patients, we found molecular signatures of dysfunctional mitochondrial dynamics and impaired mitophagy/autophagy. In primary cells depleted for CSA or CSB, this dysfunction can be corrected with supplementation of NAD+ precursors.

Objectives: To summarise the Web-based ‘channels’ that may assist the actors of the health care system (clinicians, medical researchers and students) to keep up to date with medical information. Methods: We searched PubMed and Scopus for English language articles published between January 1990 and February 2019 that investigated ways for keeping up with medical information. We used the results from our search and relevant information from other sources to conduct a narrative synthesis. Results: We found that resources that push information (e.g. web alerts, medical newsletters, listservs), resources that rely on the active information seeking (e.g. access to health librarians and electronic databases, podcasts, mobile apps), collaborative resources (e.g. web conferences, online journal clubs, web social media) and resources that synthesise information (e.g. bibliometrics, living systematic reviews) can contribute in keeping up with new findings and can enhance evidence-based medicine. Clinicians, medical researchers and students can benefit from the proper use of such Internet-based technological innovations.

Amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) generated from its precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase (or BACE1) and γ-secretase endoproteolysis. Alternative APP cleavage by α-secretase (a family of membrane-bound metalloproteases– Adamalysins) precludes the generation of toxic Aβ and yields a neuroprotective and neurotrophic secreted sAPPα fragment. Several signal transduction pathways, including protein kinase C and MAP kinase, stimulate α-secretase. We present data to suggest that rivastigmine, in addition to anticholinesterase activity, directs APP processing away from BACE1 and towards α-secretases. We treated rat neuronal PC12 cells and primary human brain (PHB) cultures with rivastigmine and the α-secretase inhibitor TAPI and assayed for levels of APP processing products and α-secretases. We subsequently treated 3×Tg (transgenic) mice with rivastigmine and harvested hippocampi to assay for levels of APP processing products. We also assayed postmortem human control, AD, and AD brains from subjects treated with rivastigmine for levels of APP metabolites. Rivastigmine dose-dependently promoted α-secretase activity by upregulating levels of ADAM-9, -10, and -17 α-secretases in PHB cultures. Co-treatment with TAPI eliminated rivastigmine-induced sAPPα elevation. Rivastigmine treatment elevated levels of sAPPα in 3×Tg mice. Consistent with these results, we also found elevated sAPPα in postmortem brain samples from AD patients treated with rivastigmine. Rivastigmine can modify the levels of several shedding proteins and directs APP processing toward the non-amyloidogenic pathway.

There is an urgent need for effective preventive measures for ARHL because none are currently available. Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a premature aging disease that presents with progressive hearing loss at a young age, but is otherwise similar to ARHL. There are two human genetic complementation groups of CS, A and B. While the clinical phenotypes in patients are similar, the proteins have very diverse functions, and insight into their convergence is of great interest. Here, we use mouse models for CS (CSA−/− and CSBm/m) that recapitulate the hearing loss in human CS patients. We previously showed that NAD+, a key metabolite with various essential functions, is reduced in CS and associated with multiple CS phenotypes. In this study, we report that NAD+ levels are reduced in the cochlea of CSBm/m mice and that short-term treatment (10 days) with the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR), prevents hearing loss, restores outer hair cell loss, and improves cochlear health in CSBm/m mice. Similar, but more modest effects were observed in CSA−/− mice. Remarkably, we observed a reduction in synaptic ribbon counts in the presynaptic zones of inner hair cells in both CSA−/− and CSBm/m mice, pointing to a converging mechanism for cochlear defects in CS. Ribbon synapses facilitate rapid and sustained synaptic transmission over long periods of time. Ribeye, a core protein of synaptic ribbons, possesses an NAD(H) binding pocket which regulates its activity. Intriguingly, NAD+ supplementation rescues reduced synaptic ribbon formation in both CSA−/− and CSBm/m mutant cochleae. These findings provide valuable insight into the mechanism of CS- and ARHL-associated hearing loss, and suggest a possible intervention.",NA,1

CRL4 is recruited to chromatin by the replication origin binding protein RepID/DCAF14/PHIP. During mitosis, CRL4 dissociates from RepID and replaces it with RB Binding Protein 7 (RBBP7), which ubiquitinates the SAC mediator BUB3 to enable mitotic exit. During interphase, BUB3 is protected from CRL4-mediated degradation by associating with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, ensuring its availability upon mitotic onset.

The Collaborative Aging Research Using Technology (CART) initiative was introduced to establish a digital technology research platform that could widely assess activity in the homes of diverse cohorts of older adults and detect meaningful change longitudinally. This paper reports on the built end-to-end design of the CART platform, its functionality, and the resulting research capabilities. Methods: CART platform development followed a principled design process aiming for scalability, use case flexibility, longevity, and data privacy protection while allowing sharability. The platform, comprising ambient technology, wearables, and other sensors, was deployed in participants' homes to provide continuous, long-term (months to years), and ecologically valid data. Data gathered from CART homes were sent securely to a research server for analysis and future data sharing. Results: The CART system was created, iteratively tested, and deployed to 232 homes representing four diverse cohorts (African American, Latinx, low-income, and predominantly rural-residing veterans) of older adults (n = 301) across the USA. Multiple measurements of wellness such as cognition (e.g., mean daily computer use time = 160-169 min), physical mobility (e.g., mean daily transitions between rooms = 96-155), sleep (e.g., mean nightly sleep duration = 6.3-7.4 h), and level of social engagement (e.g., reports of overnight visitors = 15-45%) were collected across cohorts. Conclusion: The CART initiative resulted in a minimally obtrusive digital health-enabled system that met the design principles while allowing for data capture over extended periods and can be widely used by the research community. The ability to monitor and manage health digitally within the homes of older adults is an important alternative to in-person assessments in many research contexts. Further advances will come with wider, shared use of the CART system in additional settings, within different disease contexts, and by diverse research teams.",NA,NA

Multivariate regression analysis was used to examine the association of IMTChange with baseline and rates of change of hemodynamic parameters and cardiovascular risk factors. IMT increased at accelerating rates from 0.02 mm/decade at age 50 years to 0.05 mm/decade at age 80 years greater rates in men than in women. IMTChange was positively associated with baseline low-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoproteinChange, and baseline systolic blood pressure and systolic blood pressureChange, but inversely with baseline diastolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressureChange . When blood pressure was expressed as pulse pressure and MAP, IMTChange was positively associated with baseline pulse pressure and pulse pressureChange and inversely with baseline mean arterial pressure and mean arterial pressureChange . In sex-specific analysis, these associations were observed in women, but not in men. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our analyses showed that IMT increases at accelerating rates with aging.

More adverse computed tomography-measured calf muscle characteristics, such as reduced calf muscle density, are associated with higher rates of mobility loss in people with PAD. Calf muscle in people with PAD may also have reduced mitochondrial activity compared with those without PAD, although evidence is inconsistent. Muscle biopsy document increased oxidative stress in PAD. Reduced calf muscle perfusion, impaired mitochondrial activity, and smaller myofibers are associated with greater walking impairment in PAD. Preliminary evidence suggests that calf muscle pathology in PAD may be reversible. In a small uncontrolled trial, revascularization improved both the ankle-brachial index and mitochondrial activity, measured by calf muscle phosphocreatine recovery time. A pilot clinical trial showed that cocoa flavanols increased measures of myofiber health, mitochondrial activity, and capillary density while simultaneously improving 6-minute walk distance in PAD.

We used analysis of covariance to assess the association of ESRD risk categories with cognitive function, controlling for cardiovascular risk factors.ResultsOver the course of 20 years, 427 participants (16% of the study population) had ≥1 episodes of ESRD risk exposure. Individuals with more risk episodes had lower composite cognitive function (p < 0.001), psychomotor speed (p < 0.001), and executive function (p = 0.007). All these associations were independent of sociodemographic status and cardiovascular risk factors.ConclusionsIn this population-based longitudinal study, we show that episodes of decline in kidney function over the young-adulthood course are associated with worse cognitive performance at midlife. Preserving kidney function in young age needs to be investigated as a potential strategy to preserve cognitive function in midlife.",NA,NA

We identified 670 participants of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging who were aged 60 and older and cognitively normal and who had concurrent data on frailty and regional microstructural neuroimaging markers by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), including mean diffusivity (MD) of gray matter and fractional anisotropy (FA) of white matter. We identified neuroimaging markers that were associated with frailty status (non-frail, pre-frail, frail) and further examined differences between three groups using multivariate linear regression (non-frail = reference). Models were adjusted for age, sex, race, years of education, body mass index, scanner type, and Apolipoprotein E e4 carrier status. Compared to the non-frail participants, those who were frail had higher MD in the medial frontal cortex, several subcortical regions (putamen, caudate, thalamus), anterior cingulate cortex, and a trend of lower FA in the body of the corpus callosum. Those who were pre-frail also had higher MD in the putamen and a trend of lower FA in the body of the corpus callosum. Our study demonstrates for the first time that the microstructure of both gray and white matter differs by frailty status in cognitively normal older adults.

Purposes: This is the first systemic review and meta-analysis on associations of PCOC with cancer patients’ adverse health care utilization, cost, patient satisfaction, and quality of care. Methods: Our study was guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) framework. Quality appraisal was performed using Downs and Black’s quality checklist. Study-level effect sizes of adverse health care utilization were computed using Cohen’s d and summarized using forest plots. Funnel plots were constructed to examine publication bias. Results: Of 334 studies that were reviewed, 10 met eligibility criteria and were included into the final analysis. Many included studies implemented almost all six of patient-centered care core attributes, plus three additional attributes that specifically addressed cancer patients’ needs, including triage pathways, standardized and evidence-based symptom management, as well as support patient navigation. PCOC patients had lower utilization of inpatient care (standardized means difference [SMD] = −0.027, p = .049). Overall positive effect of PCOC on emergency department use was small and not significant (SMD = −0.023, p = .103). With regard to cost and quality of care, our narrative summaries showed an overall positive direction, though we found limitations in individual study quality that precluded a meta-analysis. Public Implication: The results showed that it is possible to utilize patient-centered model to support best practice of cancer care.

However, T2 measurement is susceptible to inaccuracies due to Rician noise, T1 contamination, and stimulated echo effects. These error generators can all be controlled for with proper data collection and fitting methods. The objective of this study was to identify sequence parameters to appropriately acquire MR data and to establish curve fitting methods to accurately calculate disc T2 in the presence of noise by correcting for Rician noise. To do so, we compared T2 calculated from the typical monoexponential (MONO) fits and noise corrected exponential (NCEXP) fits. We examined how the selected sequence parameters altered the calculated T2 in silico and in vivo. Typical MONO fits were frequently poor due to Rician noise, and NCEXP fits were more likely to provide accurate T2 calculations. NCEXP is particularly less biased and less uncertain at low SNR. This study showed that the NCEXP using sequences with data from 20 echoes out to echo times of ~300 ms is the best method for calculating T2 of discs. By acquiring signal data out to longer echo times and accounting for Rician noise, the curve fitting is more robust in calculating T2 despite the noise in the data. This is particularly important when considering degenerate discs or AF tissue because the SNR of these regions is lower.",degenerative disc disease | intervertebral disc | MRI | Rician noise | T 2,e1102

We applied large-scale gene-set specific polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses to assess the role of common variation on PD risk focusing on publicly annotated gene sets representative of curated pathways. We nominated specific molecular sub-processes underlying protein misfolding and aggregation, post-translational protein modification, immune response, membrane and intracellular trafficking, lipid and vitamin metabolism, synaptic transmission, endosomal–lysosomal dysfunction, chromatin remodeling and apoptosis mediated by caspases among the main contributors to PD etiology. We assessed the impact of rare variation on PD risk in an independent cohort of whole-genome sequencing data and found evidence for a burden of rare damaging alleles in a range of processes, including neuronal transmission-related pathways and immune response. We explored enrichment linked to expression cell specificity patterns using single-cell gene expression data and demonstrated a significant risk pattern for dopaminergic neurons, serotonergic neurons, hypothalamic GABAergic neurons, and neural progenitors.

For diet-associated CpGs identified in epigenome-wide analyses, we conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to examine their relations to cardiovascular disease risk factors and examined their longitudinal associations with all-cause mortality. Results: We identified 30 CpGs associated with either Mediterranean-style diet score or Alternative Healthy Eating Index, or both, in European ancestry participants. Among these CpGs, 12 CpGs were significantly associated with all-cause mortality (Bonferroni corrected P<1.6×10-3). Hypermethylation of cg18181703 (SOCS3) was associated with higher scores of both Mediterranean-style diet score and Alternative Healthy Eating Index and lower risk for all-cause mortality (P=5.7×10-15). Ten additional diet-associated CpGs were nominally associated with all-cause mortality (P<0.05). MR analysis revealed 8 putatively causal associations for 6 CpGs with 4 cardiovascular disease risk factors (body mass index, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, and type 2 diabetes mellitus; Bonferroni corrected MR P<4.5×10-4). For example, hypermethylation of cg11250194 (FADS2) was associated with lower triglyceride concentrations (MR, P=1.5×10-14).and hypermethylation of cg02079413 (SNORA54; NAP1L4) was associated with body mass index (corrected MR, P=1×10-6). Conclusions: Habitual diet quality was associated with differential peripheral leukocyte DNA methylation levels of 30 CpGs, most of which were also associated with multiple health outcomes, in European ancestry individuals. These findings demonstrate that integrative genomic analysis of dietary information may reveal molecular targets for disease prevention and treatment.",cardiovascular disease | diet | DNA methylation | epigenome | triglycerides,NA

Myelin maintenance through oligodendrocyte metabolism is an energy-demanding process, so that myelin homeostasis is particularly sensitive to hypoxia, hypoperfusion or ischaemia. However, in spite of its central importance, little is known about the association between blood supply and myelin integrity. Objective To assess associations between cortical and subcortical CBF, and subcortical myelin content, in critical brain white matter regions. Materials and methods MRI was performed on a cohort of 67 cognitively unimpaired adults. Using advanced MRI methodology, we measured whole-brain longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates (R 1 and R 2), sensitive but non-specific markers of myelin content, and myelin water fraction (MWF), a direct surrogate of myelin content, as well as regional CBF, from each of these participants. Results All quantitative relaxometry metrics were positively associated with CBF in all brain regions evaluated. These associations between MWF or R 1 and CBF, and, to a lesser extent, between R 2 and CBF, were statistically significant in most brain regions examined, indicating that lower regional cortical or subcortical CBF corresponds to a decrease in local subcortical myelin content. Finally, all relaxometry metrics exhibited a quadratic, inverted U-shaped, association with age; this is attributed to the development of myelination from young to middle age, followed by progressive loss of myelin in later years. Conclusions In this first study examining the association between local blood supply and myelin integrity, we found that myelin content declines with CBF across a wide age range of cognitively normal subjects.",cerebral blood flow | MRI | myelin,e000053

In particular, MRI-derived brain age has been used as a comprehensive biomarker of brain health that can identify both advanced and resilient ageing individuals via deviations from typical brain ageing. Imaging signatures of various brain diseases, including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, have also been identified using machine learning. Prior efforts to derive these indices have been hampered by the need for sophisticated and not easily reproducible processing steps, by insufficiently powered or diversified samples from which typical brain ageing trajectories were derived, and by limited reproducibility across populations and MRI scanners. Herein, we develop and test a sophisticated deep brain network (DeepBrainNet) using a large (n = 11 729) set of MRI scans from a highly diversified cohort spanning different studies, scanners, ages and geographic locations around the world. Tests using both cross-validation and a separate replication cohort of 2739 individuals indicate that DeepBrainNet obtains robust brain-age estimates from these diverse datasets without the need for specialized image data preparation and processing. Furthermore, we show evidence that moderately fit brain ageing models may provide brain age estimates that are most discriminant of individuals with pathologies. This is not unexpected as tightly-fitting brain age models naturally produce brain-age estimates that offer little information beyond age, and loosely fitting models may contain a lot of noise. Our results offer some experimental evidence against commonly pursued tightly-fitting models. We show that the moderately fitting brain age models obtain significantly higher differentiation compared to tightly-fitting models in two of the four disease groups tested. Critically, we demonstrate that leveraging DeepBrainNet, along with transfer learning, allows us to construct more accurate classifiers of several brain diseases, compared to directly training classifiers on patient versus healthy control datasets or using common imaging databases such as ImageNet. We, therefore, derive a domain-specific deep network likely to reduce the need for application-specific adaptation and tuning of generic deep learning networks. We made the DeepBrainNet model freely available to the community for MRI-based evaluation of brain health in the general population and over the lifespan.",Brain age | Deep learning | Transfer learning,NA

The Sarcopenia Definitions and Outcomes Consortium (SDOC) was formed to develop evidence-based diagnostic cut points for lean mass and/or muscle strength that identify people at increased risk of mobility disability. We describe here the proceedings of a meeting of SDOC and other experts to discuss strategic considerations in the development of evidence-based sarcopenia definition. Methods: Presentations and panel discussions reviewed the usefulness of sarcopenia as a biomarker, the analytical approach used by SDOC to establish cut points, and preliminary findings, and provided strategic direction to develop an evidence-based definition of sarcopenia. Results: The SDOC assembled data from eight epidemiological cohorts consisting of 18,831 participants, clinical populations from 10 randomized trials and observational studies, and 2 nationally representative cohorts. In preliminary assessments, grip strength or grip strength divided by body mass index was identified as discriminators of risk for mobility disability (walking speed <0.8 m/s), whereas dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-derived lean mass measures were not good discriminators of mobility disability. Candidate definitions based on grip strength variables were associated with increased risk of mortality, falls, mobility disability, and instrumental activities of daily living disability. The prevalence of low grip strength increased with age. The attendees recommended the establishment of an International Expert Panel to review a series of position statements on sarcopenia definition that are informed by the findings of the SDOC analyses and synthesis of literature. Conclusions: International consensus on an evidence-based definition of sarcopenia is needed. Grip strength - absolute or adjusted for body mass index - is an important discriminator of mobility disability and other endpoints.

Recently, a novel conceptual model of frailty has emerged based on the loss of harmonic interaction between multiple domains (also referred as dimensions) including genetic, biological, functional, cognitive, psychological and socio-economic domain that ultimately lead to homeostatic instability. Therefore, the multidimensional aspects of frailty condition could be captured by the comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) and its derived Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI). This instrument has been applied in different clinical settings and in several cohorts of older adults with specific acute and chronic diseases, showing always excellent accuracy in stratifying population according the mortality risk and other negative health outcomes, i.e. hospitalization, institutionalization or admission to homecare services.

We report that using non-toxic mobilization-enabled preconditioning, hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation-based macrophage-mediated gene delivery may provide a solution to overcome these obstacles. Syngeneic bone marrow HSCs were transduced ex vivo with a lentiviral vector expressing macrophage promoter-driven GDNF and transplanted into 14-week-old MitoPark mice exhibiting PD-like impairments. Transplant preconditioning with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and AMD3100 was used to vacate bone marrow stem cell niches. Chimerism reached ∼80% after seven transplantation cycles. Transgene-expressing macrophages infiltrated degenerating CNS regions of MitoPark mice (not wild-type littermate controls), resulting in increased GDNF levels in the midbrain. Macrophage GDNF delivery not only markedly improved motor and non-motor dysfunction, but also dramatically mitigated the loss of dopaminergic neurons in both substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area and preserved axonal terminals in the striatum.

Methods: Data from 4469 older adults, aged 66-95 years at baseline in the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study with measurements of thigh computed tomography, isometric knee extension testing, self-reported smoking history, and potential covariates were analyzed. Results: Sex differences were observed in these data; therefore, our final analyses are stratified by sex. In men, both former smokers and current smokers had lower muscle area (with β= -0.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.17 to -0.03 and β = -0.19, 95% CI = -0.33 to -0.05, respectively) and lower muscle attenuation (ie, higher fat infiltration, β = -0.08, 95% CI = -0.16 to -0.01 and β = -0.17, 95% CI = -0.34 to -0.01, respectively) when compared with never smokers.

Among female smokers (current and former), muscle attenuation and peak torque were lower with increasing pack-years. Conclusions: Results suggest that cigarette smoking is related to multiple muscle properties at older age and that these relationships may be different among men and women. Implications: This article presents novel data, as it examined for the first time the relationship between smoking and computed tomography-derived quadriceps muscle size (cross-sectional area) and attenuation.

Twelve biomarkers representing multiple systems including stress response (e.g., inflammation), endocrine system, and energy regulation were identified. A series of confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were conducted to evaluate the interplay between physiological systems and underlying multisystem dysregulation. We evaluated convergent criterion validity of a score for multisystem dysregulation against the physical frailty phenotype, and predictive criterion validity with incidence of walking difficulty and mortality.

Preliminary evidence suggests PAD damages skeletal muscle, resulting in muscle impairments that contribute to functional decline. We sought to determine whether PAD is associated with an altered macrophage profile in gastrocnemius muscles and whether muscle macrophage populations are associated with impaired muscle phenotype and walking performance in patients with PAD. METHODS AND RESULTS: Macrophages, satellite cells, and extracellular matrix in gastrocnemius muscles from 25 patients with PAD and 7 patients without PAD were quantified using immunohistochemistry. Among patients with PAD, both the absolute number and percentage of cluster of differentiation (CD) 11b+CD206+ M2-like macrophages positively correlated to satellite cell number (r=0.461 [P=0.023] and r=0.416 [P=0.042], respectively) but not capillary density or extracellular matrix. The number of CD11b+CD206− macrophages negatively correlated to 4-meter walk tests at normal (r=−0.447, P=0.036) and fast pace (r=−0.510, P=0.014). Extracellular matrix occupied more muscle area in PAD compared with non-PAD (8.72±2.19% versus 5.30±1.03%, P<0.001) and positively correlated with capillary density (r=0.656, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Among people with PAD, higher CD206+ M2-like macrophage abundance was associated with greater satellite cell numbers and muscle fiber size. Lower CD206− macrophage abundance was associated with better walking performance.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of α-SYN-Nurr1 interaction are still rarely explored. In this study, we investigated the effect and mechanism of α-SYN on the transcription level of Nurr1. Our results showed that overexpression of α-SYN (WT or A53T) reduced Nurr1 and its downstream gene expressions. α-SYN neither affected the mRNA stability nor bound with the promoter of Nurr1, but modulated the transcription activity of Nurr1 promoter region ranging from −605 bp to −418 bp, which contains the binding site of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). Moreover, overexpression of α-SYN (WT or A53T) down-regulated NF-κB expression level, thereby inhibiting the transcription factor activity of NF-κB and decreasing the binding quantity of NF-κB with Nurr1 promoter. These findings may give us new insights to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the α-SYN-regulated Nurr1 function, which may fascinate the investigation of dopamine neuron degeneration in PD pathogenesis.",dopamine | nuclear factor κ B (NF-κB) | nuclear receptor-related 1 protein (Nurr1) | Parkinson’s disease | α-synuclein,64

We report an interaction between LRRK2 and VPS52, a subunit of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex that identifies a function of LRRK2 in regulating membrane fusion at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). At the TGN, LRRK2 further interacts with the Golgi SNAREs VAMP4 and Syntaxin-6 and acts as a scaffolding platform that stabilizes the GARP-SNAREs complex formation. Therefore, LRRK2 influences both retrograde and post-Golgi trafficking pathways in a manner dependent on its GTP binding and kinase activity. This action is exaggerated by mutations associated with Parkinson's disease and can be blocked by kinase inhibitors. Disruption of GARP sensitizes dopamine neurons to mutant LRRK2 toxicity in C. elegans, showing that these pathways are interlinked in vivo and suggesting a link in PD.",endosome | Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 | lysosome | membrane trafficking | neurodegeneration | neurodegenerative disease | neuroscience | RAB29 | RAB7L1 | VPS52,107614

However, the temporal associations between E-selectin and ICAM-1 with subclinical cardiac dysfunction are unclear. Objectives: This study sought to assess the longitudinal associations of E-selectin and ICAM-1 with subclinical alterations in cardiac function. Methods: In the Coronary Artery Disease Risk Development in Young Adults study, a cohort of black and white young adults, we evaluated the associations of E-selectin and ICAM-1, obtained at year (Y) 7 (Y7) and Y15 examinations, with cardiac function assessed at Y30 after adjustment for key covariates.

A significant three-way interaction was found for race, sex, and poverty status (odds ratio [OR] = 6.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.26-28.97], P = 0.025). Specifically, among Whites living in poverty, women were more likely to report pain than men (P = 0.043), suggesting a double disadvantage of being both female and living in poverty. Among those above the poverty line, African American (AA) men were less likely to report pain than White men (P = 0.024) and AA women (P = 0.019), potentially due to greater stoicism or coping skills and sources of resilience. Consistent with prior research, significant main effects revealed that older age (OR = 2.16, 95% CI [1.28-3.64], P = 0.004) and higher depressive symptoms (OR = 1.03, 95% CI [1.02-1.04], P < 0.001) were associated independently with increased likelihood of reporting pain. This study demonstrates that in an urban population, intersecting sociodemographic factors create unique social identities that impact pain, and emphasizes the need for identification of relevant mediational pathways.",NA,NA

Objective: The objective of this study was to examine baseline clinical and DAT imaging characteristics in GBA and LRRK2 mutation carriers with early PD compared with sporadic PD. Methods: The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative is an ongoing observational longitudinal study that enrolled participants with sporadic PD, LRRK2 and GBA PD carriers from 33 sites worldwide. All participants are assessed annually with a battery of motor and nonmotor scales, 123-I Ioflupane DAT imaging, and biologic variables. Results: We assessed 158 LRRK2 (89% G2019S), 80 GBA (89 %N370S), and 361 sporadic PD participants with the mean (standard deviation) disease duration of 2.9 (1.9), 3.1 (2.0), and 2.6 (0.6) years, respectively. When compared with sporadic PD, the GBA PD patients had no difference in any motor, cognitive, or autonomic features. The LRRK2 PD patients had less motor disability and lower rapid eye movement behavior disorder questionnaire scores, but no meaningful difference in cognitive or autonomic features. Both genetic cohorts had a higher score on the impulse control disorders scale when compared with sporadic PD, but no difference in other psychiatric features. Both genetic PD cohorts had less loss of dopamine transporter on DAT imaging when compared with sporadic PD. Conclusions: We confirm previous reports of milder phenotype associated with LRRK2-PD.

In keeping with the fact that HuR increased the abundance of adhesion molecule VLA-4 on Th17 cells, knockout of HuR impaired splenic Th17 cell migration to the CNS and abolished the disease. Accordingly, targeting HuR by its inhibitor DHTS inhibited splenic Th17 cell differentiation and reduced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis severity.

Previous work has suggested that a subset of LH GABA neurons projects to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and targets GABA neurons, inhibiting them and thereby disinhibiting dopaminergic activity and release. Furthermore, stimulation-induced eating is attenuated by dopamine lesions or receptor antagonists. Here we explored the involvement of dopamine in LH stimulation-induced eating. LH stimulation caused sated mice to pick up pellets of standard chow with latencies that varied based on stimulation intensity; once food was picked up, animals ate for the remainder of the 60-s stimulation period. However, lesion of VTA GABA neurons failed to disrupt this effect. Moreover, direct stimulation of VTA or substantia nigra dopamine cell bodies failed to induce food approach or eating. Looking further, we found that some LH GABA fibers pass through the VTA to more caudal sites, where they synapse onto neurons near the locus coeruleus (LC). Similar eating was induced by stimulation of LH GABA terminals or GABA cell bodies in this peri-LC region. Lesion of peri-LC GABA neurons blocked LH stimulation-induced eating, establishing them as a critical downstream circuit element for LH neurons. Surprisingly, lesions did not alter body weight, suggesting that this system is not involved in the hunger or satiety mechanisms that govern normal feeding. Thus, we present a characterization of brain circuitry that may promote overeating and contribute to obesity.",Eating | LC | LH | Reward | VTA,NA

We examined the relationship of housing insecurity and risk of kidney disease. Methods We used longitudinal data from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study (Baltimore, MD). We used multivariable regression to quantify associations between housing insecurity and rapid kidney function decline (loss of >5 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 of eGFR per year) and, among those without kidney disease at baseline, incident reduced kidney function (eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2) and incident albuminuria (urine albumin-creatinine ratio [ACR] ≥30 mg/g). Results Among 1262 participants, mean age was 52 years, 40% were male and 57% were black. A total of 405 (32%) reported housing insecurity. After a median of 3.5 years of follow-up, rapid kidney function decline, incident reduced kidney function, and incident albuminuria occurred in 199 (16%), 64 (5%), and 74 (7%) participants, respectively.

The tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) antagonist infliximab was recently reported to improve depressive symptoms in a subpopulation of individuals with BD and history of childhood maltreatment. To explore the mechanistic mediators of infliximab’s effects, we investigated its engagement with biomarkers of cellular response to inflammation derived from plasma extracellular vesicles enriched for neuronal origin (NEVs). We hypothesized that infliximab, compared to placebo, would decrease TNF-α receptors (TNFRs) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway signaling biomarkers, and that history of childhood abuse would moderate infliximab’s effects. We immunocaptured NEVs from plasma samples collected at baseline and at weeks 2, 6, and 12 (endpoint) from 55 participants of this clinical trial and measured NEV biomarkers using immunoassays. A subset of participants (n = 27) also underwent whole-brain magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and endpoint. Childhood physical abuse moderated treatment by time interactions for TNFR1 (χ2 = 9.275, p = 0.026), NF-κB (χ2 = 13.825, p = 0.003), and inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBα) (χ2 = 7.990, p = 0.046), indicating that higher levels of physical abuse were associated with larger biomarker decreases over time. Moreover, the antidepressant response to infliximab was moderated by TNFR1 (χ2 = 7.997, p = 0.046). In infliximab-treated participants, reductions in TNFR1 levels were associated with improvement of depressive symptoms, an effect not detected in the placebo group. Conversely, reductions in TNFR1 levels were associated with increased global cortical thickness in infliximab-(r = –0.581, p = 0.029), but not placebo-treated, patients (r = 0.196, p = 0.501).

A total of 52,668 hospital discharge records met eligibility criteria among PCOS women, 18-49 years. Of those, 17,759 had an obesity/overweight diagnosis and 4310 underwent bariatric surgery. Furthermore, 3086 underwent RYGB (n = 2411), LSG (n = 126), or LAGB (n = 549), and were compared to 78,931 non-PCOS controls. Multiple regression models were constructed to examine patient- and hospital-level predictors of obesity/overweight and bariatric surgery, as well as type of bariatric surgery (RYGB, LSG, or LAGB) as a predictor of in-hospital outcomes and PCOS status. Results: The prevalence of obesity/overweight (≈34%) among women diagnosed with PCOS, and of bariatric surgery (≈24%) among women diagnosed with PCOS and obese/overweight varied by patient- and hospital-level characteristics. Women having PCOS and overweight/obesity, who underwent LSG or LAGB, had shorter hospital stay, reduced hospital charges, and better disposition at discharge compared to those who underwent RYGB. PCOS cases and non-PCOS controls experienced similar treatment selection and in-hospital outcomes after bariatric surgery. Also, PCOS cases and non-PCOS controls experienced similar in-hospital outcomes after undergoing RYGB, LSG, or LAGB.

Using longitudinal data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), we propose a conceptual framework to identify metrics of ageing that may capture the hierarchical and temporal relationships between functional ageing, phenotypic ageing and biological ageing based on four hypothesized domains: body composition, energy regulation, homeostatic mechanisms and neurodegeneration/neuroplasticity. We explored the longitudinal trajectories of key variables within these phenotypes using linear mixed-effects models and more than 10 years of data.

So far, highly-penetrant rare genetic alterations in SNCA, LRRK2, VPS35, PRKN, PINK1, DJ-1 and GBA have been linked with typical familial PD and common genetic variability at 90 loci have been linked to risk for PD. In this review, we outline the journey thus far of PD genetics, highlighting how significant advances have improved our knowledge of the genetic basis of PD risk, onset and progression. Despite remarkable progress, our field has yet to unravel how genetic risk variants disrupt biological pathways and molecular networks underlying the pathobiology of the disease. We highlight that currently identified genetic risk factors only represent a fraction of the likely genetic risk for PD. Identifying the remaining genetic risk will require us to diversify our efforts, performing genetic studies across different ancestral groups. This work will inform us on the varied genetic basis of disease across populations and also aid in fine mapping discovered loci. If we are able to take this course, we foresee that genetic discoveries in PD will directly influence our ability to predict disease and aid in defining etiological subtypes, critical steps for the implementation of precision medicine for PD.",Genetics | Parkinson's disease | Post-GWAS era | Risk,104782

Jump peak power (Watts/kg body weight), force (Newton/kg body weight) at peak power, and velocity (m/s) at peak power were measured by jump tests on a force plate. Grip strength (kg/kg body weight) was assessed by hand-held dynamometry. Physical performance included 400 m walk time (s), 6 m usual gait speed (m/s), and 5-repeated chair stands speed (#/s). Results: In adjusted Pearson correlations, power/kg and velocity moderately correlated with all performance measures (range r = 0.41–0.51; all p < 0.001), while correlations for force/kg and grip strength/kg were weaker (range r = 0.20–0.33; all p < 0.001).

Under high glucose and β-adrenergic stimulation conditions, palmitate can, at least in part, offset left ventricle (LV) dysfunction in hearts from diabetic mice, improving contractility and relaxation while restoring coronary perfusion pressure. Fluxome calculations of central catabolism in diabetic hearts show that, in the presence of palmitate, there is a metabolic remodelling involving tricarboxylic acid cycle, polyol and pentose phosphate pathways, leading to improved redox balance in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments. Under high glucose and increased energy demand, the metabolic/fluxomic redirection leading to restored redox balance imparted by palmitate helps explain maintained LV function and may contribute to designing novel therapeutic approaches to prevent cardiac dysfunction in diabetic patients. Abstract: Type-2 diabetes (T2DM) leads to reduced myocardial performance, and eventually heart failure. Excessive accumulation of lipids and glucose is central to T2DM cardiomyopathy. Previous data showed that palmitate (Palm) or glutathione preserved heart mitochondrial energy/redox balance under excess glucose, rescuing β-adrenergic-stimulated cardiac excitation–contraction coupling. However, the mechanisms underlying the accompanying improved contractile performance have been largely ignored. Herein we explore in intact heart under substrate excess the metabolic remodelling associated with cardiac function in diabetic db/db mice subjected to stress given by β-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol and high glucose compared to their non-diabetic controls (+/+, WT) under euglycaemic conditions. When perfused with Palm, T2DM hearts exhibited improved contractility/relaxation compared to WT, accompanied by extensive metabolic remodelling as demonstrated by metabolomics–fluxomics combined with bioinformatics and computational modelling. The T2DM heart metabolome showed significant differences in the abundance of metabolites in pathways related to glucose, lipids and redox metabolism. Using a validated computational model of heart's central catabolism, comprising glucose and fatty acid (FA) oxidation in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments, we estimated that fluxes through glucose degradation pathways are ∼2-fold lower in heart from T2DM vs. WT under all conditions studied. Palm addition elicits improvement of the redox status via enhanced β-oxidation and decreased glucose uptake, leading to flux-redirection away from redox-consuming pathways (e.g. polyol) while maintaining the flux through redox-generating pathways together with glucose–FA ‘shared fuelling’ of oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, available FAs such as Palm may help improve function via enhanced redox balance in T2DM hearts during peaks of hyperglycaemia and increased workload.",diabetic cardiomyopathy | fluxomics | metabolomics,NA

While the precise mechanisms are not fully understood, alterations in kinase pathways including that of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 have been proposed to play a role. In AD, p38α activation has been linked to neuro-inflammation while alterations in p38γ have been associated with tau phosphorylation. Although p38 has been studied in AD, less is known about its role in DLB/PD and other α-synucleinopathies. For this purpose, we investigated the expression of the p38 family in brains from α-syn overexpressing transgenic mice (α-syn Tg: Line 61) and patients with DLB/PD. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that in healthy human controls and non-Tg mice, p38α associated with neurons and astroglial cells and p38γ localized to pre-synaptic terminals. In DLB and α-syn Tg brains, however, p38α levels were increased in astroglial cells while p38γ immunostaining was redistributed from the synaptic terminals to the neuronal cell bodies. Double immunolabeling further showed that p38γ colocalized with α-syn aggregates in DLB patients, and immunoblot and qPCR analysis confirmed the increased levels of p38α and p38γ. α1-syntrophin, a synaptic target of p38γ, was present in the neuropil and some neuronal cell bodies in human controls and non-Tg mice. In DLB and and Tg mice, however, α1-syntrophin was decreased in the neuropil and instead colocalized with α-syn in intra-neuronal inclusions. In agreement with these findings, in vitro studies showed that α-syn co-immunoprecipitates with p38γ, but not p38α. These results suggest that α-syn might interfere with the p38γ pathway and play a role in the mechanisms of synaptic dysfunction in DLB/PD.",dementia with Lewy bodies | MAPK | p38gamma | synaptic pathology | synucleinopathies | α-synuclein,286

Mortality was ascertained through December 2015. Exposures: Accelerometer-measured number of steps per day and 3 step intensity measures (extended bout cadence, peak 30-minute cadence, and peak 1-minute cadence [steps/min]). Accelerometer data were based on measurements obtained during a 7-day period at baseline. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs), mortality rates, and 95% CIs were estimated using cubic splines and quartile classifications adjusting for age; sex; race/ethnicity; education; diet; smoking status; body mass index; self-reported health; mobility limitations; and diagnoses of diabetes, stroke, heart disease, heart failure, cancer, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema.

In addition, CSA induces ubiquitination of Ncl, enhances binding of CSB to Ncl, and CSA and CSB both stimulate the binding of Ncl to rDNA and subsequent rRNA synthesis. CSB and CSA also increase RNA Polymerase I loading to the coding region of the rDNA and this is Ncl dependent.

Performance is also affected by body composition and specific strength, which differ by race. We assessed whether racial differences in physical performance exist among older adults with high education and similar income and whether body composition and specific strength attenuate observed differences. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of 536 men (18% black) and 576 women (28% black) aged more than 60 years from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Body composition was evaluated using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Specific strength was assessed by quadricep peak torque divided by height-normalized thigh cross-sectional area and grip strength divided by body mass index-normalized appendicular lean mass. Physical performance was assessed using usual gait speed and fast 400 m walk time. Sex-stratified linear regression models, adjusted for age, height, education, and recent income, determined whether body composition or specific strength attenuated associations between race and physical performance. Results: Blacks were younger, with higher weight and appendicular lean mass. Black women had higher percent fat and specific strength. In both sexes, blacks had poorer physical performance after adjustment for socioeconomic factors. In women, neither body composition nor specific strength altered the association with gait speed. In men, neither body composition nor specific strength attenuated racial differences in either performance measure. Conclusions: Poorer physical performance among black compared to white older adults persists among persons with high education and similar income and cannot generally be attributed to differences in body composition or specific strength.",Gait | Health disparities | Minority aging | Minority health | Physical function,NA

Behaviorally, reward magnitude discrimination was the same between young and old rats, and yet these same rats exhibited reduced sensitivity to positive, but not negative, choice outcomes. The latter behavioral result was congruent with additional findings that the aged ventral tegmental neurons (including dopamine cells) were less responsive to rewards when compared to the same cell types recorded from young animals.

Since these diseases are associated with hypoadiponectinemia, it is suggested that loss of function of APN might be involved. In contrast, despite beneficial properties for cardiovascular cells, APN is detrimental in circulatory diseases, including chronic heart failure (CHF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Notably, such an APN paradox might also be applicable to neurodegeneration. Although APN is neuroprotective in various experimental systems, APN was shown to be associated with the severity of amyloid accumulation and cognitive decline in a recent prospective cohort study in elderly. Furthermore, Alzheimer's disease (AD) was associated with hyperadiponectinemia in many studies. Moreover, APN was sequestered by phospho-tau into the neurofibrillary tangle in the postmortem AD brains. These results collectively indicate that APN might increase the risk of AD. In this context, the objective of the present study is to elucidate the mechanism of the APN paradox in AD. Hypothetically, APN might be involved in the stimulation of the amyloidogenic evolvability in reproductive stage, which may later manifest as AD by the antagonistic pleiotropy mechanism during aging. Given the accumulating evidence that AD and CHF are mechanistically overlapped, it is further proposed that the APN paradox of AD might be converged with those of other diseases, such as CHF and CKD.",adiponectin | adiponectin paradox | Alzheimer's disease (AD) | antagonistic pleiotropy | chronic heart failure (CHF) | evolvability,108

Here, we show that hippocampal neurons in six-month-old transgenic mouse model of tauopathy, THY-Tau22, are enriched with oligomeric tau, contain elongated mitochondria, and display cellular stress, but no overt cytotoxicity compared to the control mice. The levels of several key mitochondrial proteins were markedly different between the THY-Tau22 and control mice hippocampi including the mitochondrial SIRT3, PINK1, ANT1 and the fission protein DRP1. DNA base excision repair (BER) is the primary defense system against oxidative DNA damage and it was elevated in six-month-old transgenic mice. DNA polymerase β, the key BER DNA polymerase, was enriched in the cytoplasm of hippocampal neurons in six-month-old transgenic mice and localized with and within mitochondria. Polβ also co-localized with mitochondria in human AD brains in neurons containing oligomeric tau. Most of these altered mitochondrial and DNA repair events were specific to the transgenic mice at 6 months of age and were not different from control mice at 12 months of age when tau pathology reaches its maximum and oligomeric forms of tau are no longer detectable. In summary, our data suggests that we have identified key cellular stress responses at early stages of tau pathology to preserve neuronal integrity and to promote survival.

Meta-analysis of RCTs showed that, compared with placebo, MCTs elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate [MD = 0.355; 95 % CI (0.286, 0.424), I2 = 0 %], showed a trend towards cognitive improvement on ADAS-Cog [MD = −0.539; 95% CI (−1.239, −0.161), I2 = 0 %], and significantly improved cognition on a combined measure (ADAS-Cog with MMSE) [SMD = −0.289; 95 % CI (−0.551, −0.027), I2 = 0 %]. Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, we demonstrated that MCTs can induce mild ketosis and may improve cognition in patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.

This study compared relative changes in maximal treadmill walking distance versus 6-minute walk distance in response to a therapeutic intervention or control in randomized trials of participants with PAD. Methods: Data from four randomized trials of therapeutic interventions in participants with PAD that measured both 6-minute walk and treadmill walking performance at baseline and the 6-month follow-up were combined. Two trials studied supervised treadmill exercise, one studied home-based walking exercise, and one studied resveratrol. Results: Of 467 participants (mean age, 69.8; standard deviation, 9.7), the mean ankle-brachial index was 0.66 (standard deviation, 0.17). At the 6-month follow-up, participants with PAD randomized to control or placebo significantly declined in 6-minute walk distance (−10.2 m; 95% confidence interval, −18.2 to −2.2; P =.013), but improved maximal treadmill walking distance (+25.7 m; 95% CI, +6.0 to +45.3 m; P =.010; difference between change in 6-minute walk versus maximal treadmill walking distance: −37.3 m; 95% CI, −56.4 to −18.2; P <.001). Home-based exercise improved the 6-minute walk distance by 43.2 m (95% CI, +28.4 to +57.9), and supervised treadmill exercise improved the 6-minute walk distance by 25.0 m (95% CI, +14.7 to +35.2; mean difference, +18.2 m favoring home-based exercise [95% CI, +0.2 to +36.2 m; P =.048]). Among all participants, the presence (vs absence) of treadmill exercise training was associated with a 141.3-m greater improvement in maximal treadmill walking distance compared to 6-minute walk distance (95% CI, 88.2-194.4; P <.001), suggesting a benefit from treadmill training on the treadmill outcome. Conclusions: Maximal treadmill walking distance and the 6-minute walk distance are not interchangeable outcomes in participants with PAD. Participants with PAD randomized to control groups improved treadmill walking distance but simultaneously meaningfully declined in 6-minute walk distance.

Objective: We sought to determine whether transcriptional regulation of SYK through unique silencing of the SYK gene determines its basophil-specific expression patterns. Methods: Culture-derived basophils (CD34B cells) were derived from cultures of CD34+ progenitor cells by using 2 methods (G1 or G3). Peripheral blood basophils (PBBs; relative SYK protein level = 1), B cells (SYK = 8), CD34B-G1 cells (SYK = 11), and CD34B-G3 cells (SYK = 5) were examined by using assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) methods. In addition, the transcriptomes of 6 cell types, PBBs, peripheral blood eosinophils (SYK = 11), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (SYK = 30), CD34+ progenitors (SYK = 11), CD34B-G1 cells, and CD34B-G3 cells, were analyzed for patterns that matched patterns of SYK expression in these cells, with a focus on transcription factors. Results: ATAC-seq showed that PBBs have multiple open regions in the SYK gene, suggesting a nonsilenced state with 1 region unique to PBBs (low SYK expression), 1 region unique to both PBBs (low SYK expression) and both G1 and G3 CD34B cells (high and moderate SYK expression, respectively), and 5 regions unique to B cells (high SYK expression). SYK expression across the 6 cell types explored showed a unique pattern that was matched to expression patterns of 3 transcription factors: Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), zinc-finger protein 608 (ZNF608), and musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma protein (c-MAF). Conclusions: Two new potential regulatory pathways for SYK expression were identified.

The maintenance of genomic and epigenomic integrity is critical for proper function of cells and tissues throughout life, and this homeostasis is under constant strain from both extrinsic and intrinsic insults. Considering the relationship between lifespan and genotoxic burden, it is plausible that the longest-lived cellular populations would face an accumulation of DNA damage over time. Tissue-specific stem cells are multipotent populations residing in localized niches and are responsible for maintaining all lineages of their resident tissue/system throughout life. However, many of these stem cells are impacted by genotoxic stress. Several factors may dictate the specific stem cell population response to DNA damage, including the niche location, life history, and fate decisions after damage accrual. This leads to differential handling of DNA damage in different stem cell compartments. Given the importance of adult stem cells in preserving normal tissue function during an individual’s lifetime, DNA damage sensitivity and accumulation in these compartments could have crucial implications for aging. Despite this, more support for direct functional effects driven by accumulated DNA damage in adult stem cell compartments is needed.

Objective: To assess the risk of dementia in older persons who experience parallel declines in memory and gait speed compared with those who experience no decline or decline in either memory or gait speed only. Design, Setting, and Participants: A multicohort meta-analysis was performed of 6 prospective cohort studies conducted between 1997 and 2018 in the United States and Europe. Participants were 60 years or older, had an initial gait speed of more than 0.6 m/s (ie, free of overt dismobility), with repeated measures of memory and gait speed before dementia diagnosis during a mean follow-up of 6.6 to 14.5 years. Within each study, participants were divided into 4 groups: memory decline only, gait speed decline only, dual decline, or no decline (hereafter referred to as usual agers). Gait decline was defined as a loss of 0.05 m/s or more per year; memory decline was defined as being in the cohort-specific lowest tertile of annualized change. Main Outcomes and Measures: Risk of incident dementia according to group membership was examined by Cox proportional hazards regression with usual agers as the reference, adjusted for baseline age, sex, race/ethnicity, educational level, study site, and baseline gait speed and memory. Results: Across the 6 studies of 8699 participants, mean age ranged between 70 and 74 years and mean gait speed ranged between 1.05 and 1.26 m/s.

We identified ab TCR sequences that were unique to either tTreg or Tconv and found that these were distinct as recognized by machine learning algorithm and by preferentially used amino acid trimers in ab CDR3 of tTreg. In addition, a proportion of ab TCR sequences expressed by tTreg were also found in Tconv, and machine learning classified the great majority of these shared ab TCR sequences as characteristic of Tconv and not tTreg. These findings identify two populations of tTreg, one in which the regulatory T cell fate is associated with unique properties of the TCR and another with TCR properties characteristic of Tconv for which tTreg fate is determined by factors beyond TCR sequence.",NA,NA

Objective: To investigate the regulation and function of the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 (dynamin-related protein 1) in lipid overload-induced cardiomyocyte death and heart dysfunction. Methods and Results: Mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) developed signs of obesity and type II diabetes mellitus, including hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertension. HFD for 18 weeks also induced heart hypertrophy, fibrosis, myocardial insulin resistance, and cardiomyocyte death. HFD stimulated mitochondrial fission in mouse hearts. Furthermore, HFD increased the protein level, phosphorylation (at the activating serine 616 sites), oligomerization, mitochondrial translocation, and GTPase activity of Drp1 in mouse hearts, indicating that Drp1 was activated. Monkeys fed a diet high in fat and cholesterol for 2.5 years also exhibited myocardial damage and Drp1 activation in the heart. Interestingly, HFD decreased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized) levels and increased Drp1 acetylation in the heart. In adult cardiomyocytes, palmitate increased Drp1 acetylation, phosphorylation, and protein levels, and these increases were abolished by restoration of the decreased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized) level. Proteomics analysis and in vitro screening revealed that Drp1 acetylation at lysine 642 (K642) was increased by HFD in mouse hearts and by palmitate incubation in cardiomyocytes. The nonacetylated Drp1 mutation (K642R) attenuated palmitate-induced Drp1 activation, its interaction with voltage-dependent anion channel 1, mitochondrial fission, contractile dysfunction, and cardiomyocyte death. Conclusions: These findings uncover a novel mechanism that contributes to lipid overload-induced heart hypertrophy and dysfunction. Excessive lipid supply created an intracellular environment that facilitated Drp1 acetylation, which, in turn, increased its activity and mitochondrial translocation, resulting in cardiomyocyte dysfunction and death. Thus, Drp1 may be a critical mediator of lipid overload-induced heart dysfunction as well as a potential target for therapy.",acetylation | diabetes mellitus | dynamins | heart | mitochondria,NA

Genetic variables represent a predisposing factor to the disease and mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) locus have been correlated to late-onset autosomal-dominant PD. The common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster carrying the mutation LRRK2 loss-of-function in the WD40 domain (LRRK2WD40), is a simple in vivo model of PD and is a valid tool to first evaluate novel therapeutic approaches to the disease. Recent studies have suggested a neuroprotective activity of immunomodulatory agents in PD models. Here the immunomodulatory drug Pomalidomide (POM), a Thalidomide derivative, was examined in the Drosophila LRRK2WD40 genetic model of PD. Mutant and wild type flies received increasing POM doses (1, 0.5, 0.25 mM) through their diet from day 1 post eclosion, until postnatal day (PN) 7 or 14, when POM’s actions were evaluated by quantifying changes in climbing behavior as a measure of motor performance, the number of brain dopaminergic neurons and T-bars, mitochondria integrity. LRRK2WD40 flies displayed a spontaneous age-related impairment of climbing activity, and POM significantly and dose-dependently improved climbing performance both at PN 7 and PN 14. LRRK2WD40 fly motor disability was underpinned by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in posterior clusters of the protocerebrum, which are involved in the control of locomotion, by a low number of T-bars density in the presynaptic bouton active zones. POM treatment fully rescued the cell loss in all posterior clusters at PN 7 and PN 14 and significantly increased the T-bars density. Moreover, several damaged mitochondria with dilated cristae were observed in LRRK2WD40 flies treated with vehicle but not following POM. This study demonstrates the neuroprotective activity of the immunomodulatory agent POM in a genetic model of PD. POM is an FDA-approved clinically available and well-tolerated drug used for the treatment of multiple myeloma.

AP sites arise due to damage-induced (e.g. alkylation) or spontaneous hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond that links the base to the sugar moiety of the phosphodiester backbone, or through the enzymatic activity of DNA glycosylases, which release inappropriate bases as part of the base excision repair (BER) response. Unrepaired AP sites, which lack instructional information, have the potential to cause mutagenesis or to arrest progressing DNA or RNA polymerases, potentially causing outcomes such as cellular transformation, senescence or death. The predominant enzyme in humans responsible for repairing AP lesions is AP endonuclease 1 (APE1). Besides being a powerful AP endonuclease, APE1 possesses additional DNA repair activities, such as 3′-5′ exonuclease, 3′-phophodiesterase and nucleotide incision repair. In addition, APE1 has been shown to stimulate the DNA-binding activity of a number of transcription factors through its 'REF1' function, thereby regulating gene expression. In this article, we review the structural and biochemical features of this multifunctional protein, while reporting on new structures of the APE1 variants Cys65Ala and Lys98Ala. Using a functional complementation approach, we also describe the importance of the repair and REF1 activities in promoting cell survival, including the proposed passing-the-baton coordination in BER.

Conclusions: Among African Americans, those reporting high levels of discrimination and depressive symptoms have increased carotid atherosclerosis and may be at greater risk for clinical end points compared with those reporting one or neither of these risk factors. Findings suggest that assessment of interactive relationships among social and psychological factors may elucidate novel pathways for cardiovascular disease, including stroke, among African Americans.",Atherosclerosis | Health disparities | Intimal-medial thickness | Psychosocial vulnerabilities | Risk factors | Subclinical vascular disease,NA

Objective: To test the predictive capacity of the CAIDE dementia risk score among a cohort of Japanese-American men. Methods: Midlife measures were obtained from a sample of 3,582 Japanese-American men in the Honolulu Heart Program (1965-1968, average age = 53.1 years). A follow-up exam in 1991 (average age = 77.8 years) assessed cognitive impairment using the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI).

Results: In this cohort, the CAIDE dementia risk score demonstrates significant association with later-life severe cognitive impairment (OR = 1.477, 95% CI: 1.39-1.58). However, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve c-statistics suggests poor predictive ability (c = 0.645, 95% CI: 0.62-0.67). Using a score cut-point of 10, the accuracy is acceptable (0.82), but the sensitivity is low (0.50).

Supplementation with n-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) during pregnancy has been reported to decrease the risk of preterm birth in singleton pregnancies, which may be due to effects of DHA supplementation on oxylipins or their precursor n-6 and n-3 fatty acids. There is only limited understanding of the levels and trajectory of changes in plasma oxylipins during pregnancy, effects of DHA supplementation on oxylipins and unesterified fatty acids, and whether and how oxylipins and their unesterified precursor fatty acids influence preterm birth. In the present study we used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to profile oxylipins and their precursor fatty acids in the unesterified pool using plasma samples collected from a subset of pregnant Australian women who participated in the ORIP (Omega-3 fats to Reduce the Incidence of Prematurity) study. ORIP is a large randomized controlled trial testing whether daily supplementation with n-3 DHA can reduce the incidence of early preterm birth compared to control. Plasma was collected at study entry (≈pregnancy week 14) and again at ≈week 24, in a subgroup of 48 ORIP participants—12 cases with spontaneous preterm (<37 weeks) birth and 36 matched controls with spontaneous term (≥40 weeks) birth. In the combined preterm and term pregnancies, we observed that in the control group without DHA supplementation unesterified AA and AA-derived oxylipins 12-HETE, 15-HETE and TXB2 declined between weeks 14–24 of pregnancy. Compared to control, DHA supplementation increased unesterified DHA, EPA, and AA, DHA-derived 4-HDHA, 10-HDHA and 19,20-EpDPA, and AA-derived 12-HETE at 24 weeks.

However, the mechanisms regulating hepatic DAGL gene expression and 2-AG production are largely unknown. In this study, we show that CB1R-induced estrogen-related receptor γ (ERRγ) controls hepatic DAGL gene expression and 2-AG levels. Arachidonyl-2′-chloroethylamide (ACEA), a synthetic CB1R agonist, significantly upregulated ERRγ, DAGLα, and DAGLβ, and increased 2-AG levels in the liver (10 mg/kg) and hepatocytes (10 μM) of wild-type (WT) mice. ERRγ overexpression upregulated DAGLα and DAGLβ expressions and increased 2-AG levels, whereas ERRγ knockdown abolished ACEA-induced DAGLα, DAGLβ, and 2-AG in vitro and in vivo. Promoter assays showed that ERRγ positively regulated DAGLα and DAGLβ transcription by binding to the ERR response element in the DAGLα and DAGLβ promoters. Chronic alcohol feeding (27.5% of total calories) induced hepatic steatosis and upregulated ERRγ, leading to increased DAGLα, DAGLβ, or 2-AG in WT mice, whereas these alcohol-induced effects did not occur in hepatocyte-specific CB1R knockout mice or in those treated with the ERRγ inverse agonist GSK5182 (40 mg/kg in mice and 10 μM in vitro).

It has been suggested that the combination of various bioactive components with vitamins is crucial for their potential anticancer activities. METHODS: This study employed a combinatorial chemopreventive strategy to investigate the impact of dietary histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, that is, sulforaphane on chromatin remodeling in BC. To understand the epigenetics-mediated changes in gene expression, MCF-7 cells were exposed for 24 hr to 1,25(OH)2D3 (100nM) either alone or in combination with L-sulforaphane and TSA (20μM and 1μM, respectively) at 70% confluency. Changes in VDR, CYP24A1, CYP27B1, and TRPV6 gene expressions were quantified using real-time PCR-based assays. HDAC inhibitor activity was assessed using HDAC I/II assay that measured global changes in acetylation status. Cell viability was measured using ATP and MT assays. Clonogenic and migration assays were performed to analyze the ability of single cells to grow into colonies and % closure (migration ability) upon treatments, respectively. Results were expressed as ΔCT ± standard error of means (SEM) from One-way ANOVA analyses for mRNA expressions and mean ± SEM for all other assays. RESULTS: In MCF-7 cells, treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 tended to decrease VDR (13 ± 0.4) and CYP27B1 (12 ± 0.96), while significantly increased TRPV6 (p =.02, 14 ± 0.1) and CYP24A1 (p <.0001, 0.38 ± 0.12) expression. D alone and D + TSA group had the opposite effects on HDAC inhibition from SFN alone, D + SFN, and TSA alone. The clonogenic assay showed a significant decrease in colony formation with no colonies for D + TSA (p <.03) and TSA alone groups (p <.03). Cell viability tended to decrease with D alone and in combination with TSA. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 and sulforaphane are selective and gene-specific in MCF-7 cells. Practical applications: Breast cancer (BC) affects a large number of the U.S. population each year. Like most cancers, nutrition does play a role in the prevention of BC. However, dietary advice that includes reducing alcohol intake, red meat, and saturated fat consumption, while increasing the intake of heart-healthy fats, dietary fiber, and lean protein, etc., is difficult to apply to all cancers from a preventative standpoint. Vitamin D has been implicated in BC, mostly as a protective factor, with mixed findings. This research focuses on the role of vitamin D as a protective intervention in human BC, along with a dietary bioactive compound—sulforaphane. The idea is to combine the known benefits of a micronutrient with potential benefits of the bioactive compound to establish a stronger intervention against BC progression, irrespective of the subtype.",HAT | HDAC | histone acetyltransferase | histone deacetylase | SFN | sulforaphane | Trichostatin A | TSA | VDRE | vitamin-D response elements,e13114

Improving or preserving the health and quality of life of these individuals is challenging due to a lack of well-established clinical guidelines. Physicians are often forced to engage in cycles of “trial and error” that are centered on palliative treatment of symptoms rather than the root cause, often resulting in dubious outcomes. Recently, geroscience challenged this view, proposing that the underlying biological mechanisms of aging are central to the global increase in susceptibility to disease and disability that occurs with aging. In fact, strong correlations have recently been revealed between health dimensions and phenotypes that are typical of aging, especially with autophagy, mitochondrial function, cellular senescence, and DNA methylation. Current research focuses on measuring the pace of aging to identify individuals who are “aging faster” to test and develop interventions that could prevent or delay the progression of multimorbidity and disability with aging. Understanding how the underlying biological mechanisms of aging connect to and impact longitudinal changes in health trajectories offers a unique opportunity to identify resilience mechanisms, their dynamic changes, and their impact on stress responses.

In this work, we introduce a new approach for rapid and accurate high-resolution (HR) or ultra HR (UHR) mapping of T1 and apparent PD (APD) of the brain with correction of radiofrequency field, B1, inhomogeneities. The four-angle method (FAM) uses four spoiled-gradient recalled-echo (SPGR) images acquired at different flip angles (FA) and short repetition times (TRs). The first two SPGR images are acquired at low-spatial resolution and used to accurately map the active B1+ field with the recently introduced steady-state double angle method (SS-DAM). The estimated B1+ map is used in conjunction with the two other SPGR images, acquired at HR or UHR, to map T1 and APD. The method is evaluated with numerical, phantom, and in-vivo imaging measurements. Furthermore, we investigated imaging acceleration methods to further shorten the acquisition time. Our results indicate that FAM provides an accurate method for simultaneous HR or UHR mapping of T1 and APD in human brain in clinical high-field MRI. Derived parameter maps without B1+correction suffer from large inaccuracies, but this issue is well-corrected through use of the SS-DAM.

The standard laboratory temperature (20–22 °C), however, imposes a cold stress on mice that causes an increase in sympathetic nervous system–mediated activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) to maintain a core body temperature of 36–37 °C. Thus, while physiologic data obtained recapitulate human physiology to a certain degree, interpretations of previous research in mice may have been contaminated by a cold stress, due to housing mice below their thermoneutral zone (30 °C). The purpose of this investigation was to examine how chronic sympathetic stimulation evoked by acclimation to 20 °C might obscure interpretation of changes in autonomic modulation of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) that accompany advancing age. HR and HRV before and after administration of a dual-autonomic blockade were measured via in-vivo ECG in young (3 months) and aged (30 months) male C57BL/6 telemetry-implanted mice following temperature acclimation for 3 days at 30 °C or 20 °C. Mean basal and intrinsic HR of both young and aged mice became markedly reduced at 30 °C compared to 20 °C. In both age groups, HRV parameters in time, frequency, and non-linear domains displayed increased variability at 30 °C compared to 20 °C under basal conditions. Importantly, age-associated declines in HRV observed at 20 °C were ameliorated when mice were studied at their thermoneutral ambient temperature of 30 °C. Thus, an accurate understanding of autonomic modulation of cardiovascular functions in mice of advanced age requires that they are housed in a metabolically neutral environment.",Aging | Cardiac autonomic modulation | Heart rate | Heart rate variability | Thermoneutrality,NA

Objective: To examine transethnic gene-IMD associations for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequencies of prototypic xenobiotic response genes—aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT), AHR repressor (AHRR) — and a prototypic immune response gene, protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22), in subjects from the Environmental Polymorphisms Registry (EPR). Methods: Subjects (n = 3731) were genotyped for 14 SNPs associated with functional variants of the AHR, ARNT, AHRR, and PTPN22 genes, and their frequencies were compared among African Americans (n = 1562), Caucasians (n = 1838), and Hispanics (n = 331) with previously reported data. Of those genotyped, 2015 EPR subjects completed a Health and Exposure survey. SNPs were assessed via PLINK for associations with IMD, which included those with autoimmune diseases, allergic disorders, asthma, or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Transethnic meta-analyses were performed using METAL and MANTRA approaches. Results: ARNT SNP rs11204735 was significantly associated with autoimmune disease by transethnic meta-analyses using METAL (odds ratio, OR [95% confidence interval] = 1.29 [1.08–1.55]) and MANTRA (ORs ranged from 1.29 to 1.30), whereas ARNT SNP rs1889740 showed a significant association with autoimmune disease by METAL (OR = 1.25 [1.06–1.47]). For Caucasian females, PTPN22 SNP rs2476601 was significantly associated with autoimmune disease by allelic association tests (OR = 1.99, [1.30–3.04]). In Caucasians and Caucasian males, PTPN22 SNP rs3811021 was significantly associated with IMD (OR = 1.39 [1.12–1.72] and 1.50 [1.12–2.02], respectively) and allergic disease (OR = 1.39 [1.12–1.71], and 1.62 [1.19–2.20], respectively). In the transethnic meta-analysis, PTPN22 SNP rs3811021 was significantly implicated in IMD by METAL (OR = 1.31 [1.10–1.56]), and both METAL and MANTRA suggested that rs3811021 was associated with IMD and allergic disease in males across all three ethnic groups (IMD METAL OR = 1.50 [1.15–1.95]; IMD MANTRA ORs ranged from 1.47 to 1.50; allergic disease METAL OR = 1.58 [1.20–2.08]; allergic disease MANTRA ORs ranged from 1.55 to 1.59). Conclusions: Some xenobiotic and immune response gene polymorphisms were shown here, for the first time, to have associations across a broad spectrum of IMD and ethnicities. Our findings also suggest a role for ARNT in the development of autoimmune diseases, implicating environmental factors metabolized by this pathway in pathogenesis.

Methods: We performed a cross-sectional cohort study based on data from a multicenter, population-based study Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults. Using linear and logistic regression, we estimated the association of the composite intima–media thickness measured in three segments of carotid arteries (common carotid artery, carotid artery bulb, and internal carotid artery) with volume (cm3) and CBF (mL/100 g/min) in the total brain and gray matter as well as volume of white matter hyperintensities (cm3). Results: In the analysis, 461 participants (54% women, 34% African Americans) were included. Greater intima–media thickness was associated with lower CBF in gray matter (β=–1.36; p = .04) and total brain (β=–1.26; p = .04), adjusting for age, sex, race, education, and total brain volume. The associations became statistically nonsignificant after further controlling for cardiovascular risk factors. Intima–media thickness was not associated with volumes of total brain, gray matter, and white matter hyperintensities. Conclusions: This study suggests that lower CBF in middle age is associated with markers of atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries.

The associations between BMAT and annualized change in bone density/strength were evaluated using linear regression models, adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, estradiol, and testosterone. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the associations between baseline BMAT and incident clinical fractures, and logistic regression models for incident vertebral fractures. At baseline, mean ± SD age was 80.9 ± 4.2 and 82.6 ± 4.2 years in women (n = 148) and men (n = 150), respectively. Mean baseline BMAT was 55.4% ± 8.1% in women and 54.1% ± 8.2% in men. Incident clinical fractures occurred in 7.4% of women over 2.8 years and in 6.0% of men over 2.2 years. Incident vertebral fractures occurred in 12% of women over 3.3 years and in 17% of men over 2.7 years. Each 1 SD increase in baseline BMAT was associated with a 3.9 mg2/cm4/year greater loss of spine compressive strength index (p value =.003), a 0.9 mg/cm3/year greater loss of spine trabecular BMD (p value =.02), and a 1.2 mg/cm3/year greater loss of femoral neck trabecular BMD (p value =.02) in women. Among men, there were no associations between BMAT and changes in bone density/strength. There were no associations between BMAT and incident fractures in women or men.

These studies have largely focused on the cerebrum, with very few MR investigations addressing age-dependent differences in the brainstem, in spite of its central role in the regulation of vital functions. Several studies indicate early brainstem alterations in a myriad of neurodegenerative diseases and dementias. The paucity of MR-focused investigations is likely due in part to the challenges imposed by the small structural scale of the brainstem itself as well as of substructures within, requiring accurate high spatial resolution imaging studies. In this work, we applied our recently developed approach to high-resolution myelin water fraction (MWF) mapping, a proxy for myelin content, to investigate myelin differences with normal aging within the brainstem. In this cross-sectional investigation, we studied a large cohort (n = 125) of cognitively unimpaired participants spanning a wide age range (21–94 years) and found a decrease in myelination with age in most brainstem regions studied, with several regions exhibiting a quadratic association between myelin and age.

Methods: in this cohort study, we selected 927 community dwelling adults aged ≥65 years enrolled in the InCHIANTI study from 1998 to 2000 and followed-up for 9 years. The association between PUFA intake and serum concentration was evaluated using scatterplot and Pearson correlation test; all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regressions adjusted for potential confounders. Results: mean age of the population was 75 years (SD 7.3), 55% were women. There was no association between overall PUFAs, linolenic and linoleic acid intake and their serum concentration. There was no association between quartiles (Q) of PUFA intake and all-cause mortality: compared to Q1 of PUFA intake, the adjusted HR (95% CI) for overall mortality were: 1.05 (0.74–1.50) in Q2, 1.10 (0.76–1.58) in Q3, and 0.98 (0.68–1.41) in Q4; this lack of association was confirmed for cardiovascular mortality. Compared to Q1, participants in the fourth quartile of PUFA serum concentration had lower risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR [95%CI]: Q2 1.10 [0.79–1.53], Q3 0.84 [0.60–1.19], Q4 0.66 [0.44–0.995]), no association was found for cardiovascular mortality. Conclusions: In our sample of community-dwelling older adults, PUFA intake is not associated with PUFA serum concentration. Interventions to modulate PUFA concentration based on dietary intake may not be effective in preventing mortality in this population.",Aged | Diet | Linoleic acid | Linolenic acid | Mortality | Polyunsaturated fatty acids,NA

Values in the Alzheimer’s metabolic signature meta-ROI were negatively associated with age and exhibited longitudinal declines for each PET measure. In age-adjusted analyses, meta-ROI rCBF and R1 were lower among amyloid+ individuals; EA and R1 were lower among males.

This longitudinal study investigates whether being overweight or obese at age 8 and 13 years is associated with depressive symptoms more than 60 years later and whether this association is independent of late-life body mass index (BMI). We also investigated the association of being overweight/obese at age 8 or 13 years with ever having major depressive disorder (lifetime MDD). Method: This analysis is based on a sub-sample of 889 AGES-Reykjavik participants with measured BMI data from early life. Late-life depressive symptoms were measured with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and lifetime MDD was assessed at late-life using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the relationships between BMI (continuous and categorical) at age 8 or 13 years, and late-life depressive symptoms (measured as GDS ≥ 5) or lifetime MDD, adjusted for sex, education, physical activity, smoking status and alcohol use. In a separate model, additional adjustments were made for late-life BMI. Results: One hundred and one subjects (11%) had depressive symptoms at late-life (GDS ≥ 5), and 39 subjects (4.4%) had lifetime MDD. Being overweight or obese at age 8 or 13 years was not associated with higher depressive symptoms during late-life, irrespective of late-life BMI.

TBI has become a pressing public health concern with no specific therapeutic treatment. Mild TBI (mTBI), which accounts for approximately 90% of all TBI cases, may frequently lead to long-lasting cognitive, behavioral, and emotional impairments. The incretins glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are gastrointestinal hormones that induce glucose-dependent insulin secretion, promote β-cell proliferation, and enhance resistance to apoptosis. GLP-1 mimetics are marketed as treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and are well tolerated. Both GLP-1 and GIP mimetics have shown neuroprotective properties in animal models of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential neuroprotective effects of liraglutide, a GLP-1 analog, and twincretin, a dual GLP-1R/GIPR agonist, in a murine mTBI model. First, we subjected mice to mTBI using a weight-drop device and, thereafter, administered liraglutide or twincretin as a 7-day regimen of subcutaneous (s.c.) injections. We then investigated the effects of these drugs on mTBI-induced cognitive impairments, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation. Finally, we assessed their effects on neuroprotective proteins expression that are downstream to GLP-1R/GIPR activation; specifically, PI3K and PKA phosphorylation. Both drugs ameliorated mTBI-induced cognitive impairments evaluated by the novel object recognition (NOR) and the Y-maze paradigms in which neither anxiety nor locomotor activity were confounds, as the latter were unaffected by either mTBI or drugs. Additionally, both drugs significantly mitigated mTBI-induced neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, as quantified by immunohistochemical staining with Fluoro-Jade/anti-NeuN and anti-Iba-1 antibodies, respectively. mTBI challenge significantly decreased PKA phosphorylation levels in ipsilateral cortex, which was mitigated by both drugs. However, PI3K phosphorylation was not affected by mTBI. These findings offer a new potential therapeutic approach to treat mTBI, and support further investigation of the neuroprotective effects and mechanism of action of incretin-based therapies for neurological disorders.",concussive head injury | glucagon-like peptide-1 | glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide | incretin | liraglutide | traumatic brain injury | twincretin,356

Methods and Results: A systematic review was performed from inception until March 3, 2019. Eligibility criteria included population, adults without stroke (<4 weeks); exposure, BPV quantified by any metric over any duration; comparison, (1) low versus high or mean BPV and (2) people with versus without CSVD; and outcomes, (1) CSVD as subcortical infarct, lacunae, white matter hyperintensities, cerebral microbleeds, or enlarged perivascular spaces; and (2) standardized mean difference in BPV. A total of 27 articles were meta-analyzed, comprising 12 309 unique brain scans. A total of 31 odds ratios (ORs) were pooled, indicating that higher systolic BPV was associated with higher odds for CSVD (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.14–1.42; I2=85%) independent of mean systolic pressure. Likewise, higher diastolic BPV was associated with higher odds for CSVD (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.14–1.48; I2=53%) independent of mean diastolic pressure. There was no evidence of a pairwise interaction between systolic/diastolic and BPV/mean ORs (P=0.47), nor a difference between BPV versus mean pressure ORs (P=0.58). Fifty-four standardized mean differences were pooled and provided similar results for pairwise interaction (P=0.38) and difference between standardized mean differences (P=0.70).

Coenzyme Q deficiency constitutes a group of mitochondrial diseases. Affected patients suffer mainly a decrease in energy production that induces dysfunctions in most organs and body systems. Current therapeutic alternatives are based on increasing coenzyme Q levels either through induction of endogenous mechanisms or exogenous supplementation. This chapter includes both aspects, the mechanisms associated with the coenzyme Q supplementation and the regulatory mechanisms of coenzyme Q biosynthesis. In terms of synthesis, the structure of coenzyme Q is complicated since it requires the participation of two well-differentiated pathways that must be carefully regulated.

Substantial amounts of BDNF are present in peripheral blood, and may serve as biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease incidence as well as targets for intervention to reduce Alzheimer's disease risk. With the exception of the genetic polymorphism in the BDNF gene, Val66Met, which has been extensively studied with regard to neurodegenerative diseases, the genetic variation that influences circulating BDNF levels is unknown. We aimed to explore the genetic determinants of circulating BDNF levels in order to clarify its mechanistic involvement in brain structure and function and Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology in middle-Aged and old adults. Thus, we conducted a meta-Analysis of genome-wide association study of circulating BDNF in 11 785 middle-and old-Aged individuals of European ancestry from the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study (AGES), the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), the Rotterdam Study and the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP-Trend). Furthermore, we performed functional annotation analysis and related the genetic polymorphism influencing circulating BDNF to common Alzheimer's disease pathologies from brain autopsies. Mendelian randomization was conducted to examine the possible causal role of circulating BDNF levels with various phenotypes including cognitive function, stroke, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, physical activity and diet patterns. Gene interaction networks analysis was also performed. The estimated heritability of BDNF levels was 30% (standard error = 0.0246, P-value = 4 × 10-48). We identified seven novel independent loci mapped near the BDNF gene and in BRD3, CSRNP1, KDELC2, RUNX1 (two single-nucleotide polymorphisms) and BDNF-AS.

Seven additional genes (ACAT1, ATM, NPAT, WDR48, TTC21A, SCN114 and COX7B) were identified through expression and protein quantitative trait loci analyses. Mendelian randomization analyses indicated a potential causal role of BDNF in cardioembolism. Lastly, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis placed circulating BDNF levels in four major networks. Our study provides novel insights into genes and molecular pathways associated with circulating BDNF levels and highlights the possible involvement of plaque instability as an underlying mechanism linking BDNF with brain neurodegeneration.

Methods: The analysis reports data from 263 individuals from the BIOCARD and 184 individuals from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging with repeated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) sampling, respectively. We used latent class mixed-effect models to identify distinct classes of amyloid (CSF and PET) and p-Tau (CSF) accumulation rates and generalized additive modeling to investigate non-linear changes to AD biomarkers. Results: For both amyloid and p-Tau latent class models we confirmed the existence of two separate classes: accumulators and non-accumulators. The accumulator and non-accumulator groups differed significantly in terms of baseline AD protein levels and slope of change. APOE ε4 carrier status and episodic memory predicted amyloid class membership. Non-linear models revealed time points of significant increase in the rate of amyloid and p-Tau accumulation whereby APOE ε4 carrier status associated with earlier age at onset of rapid accumulation.

Using chromatin immune precipitation-seq-based occupancy profiles of H3K4me3 and H3Kme1 at Satb1 gene locus, we predicted four different alternative promoters of Satb1 in mouse thymocytes and characterized them. The expression of Satb1 transcript variants with distinct 5' UTRs occurs in a stage-specific manner during T-cell development and is dependent on TCR signaling. The observed discrepancy between the expression levels of SATB1 mRNA and protein in developing thymocytes can be explained by the differential translatability of Satb1 transcript variants as confirmed by polysome profiling and in vitro translation assay. We show that Satb1 alternative promoters exhibit lineage-specific chromatin accessibility during T-cell development from progenitors. Furthermore, TCF1 regulates the Satb1 P2 promoter switch during CD4SP development, via direct binding to the Satb1 P2 promoter. CD4SP T cells from TCF1 KO mice exhibit downregulation of P2 transcript variant expression as well as low levels of SATB1 protein. Collectively, these results provide unequivocal evidence toward alternative promoter switch-mediated developmental stage-specific regulation of SATB1 in thymocytes.",NA,NA

Although cross-seeding of amyloidogenic proteins (APs), including amyloid β and α-synuclein, may be critical in the co-morbidity of neurodegenerative disorders, the direct interaction of APs with prion protein (PrP), the central molecule involved in the pathogenesis of CJD, is unlikely. Currently, the nature of this biological interaction and its significance remain obscure. In this context, the objective of the present study is to discuss such interactions from the perspective of amyloidogenic evolvability, a putative function of APs. Hypothetically, both hereditary- and sporadic CJD might be attributed to the role of PrP in evolvability against multiple stressors, such as physical stresses relevant to concussions, which might be manifest through the antagonistic pleiotropy mechanism in ageing. Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that PrP- and other APs evolvability may negatively regulate each other. Provided that increased APs evolvability might be beneficial for acquired CJD in young adults, a dose-reduction of α-synuclein, a natural inhibitor of αS aggregation, might be therapeutically effective in upregulating APs evolvability.

For a subsample of 676 respondents, neuropathologic results from those with and without head injury were compared. Results: Although the crude model showed an association between history of head injury and later severe cognitive impairment, the relationship lost significance in the adjusted model (OR = 1.320, CI: 0.90-1.93), regardless of time between injury and impairment.

We hypothesized that skeletal muscle from PAD patients will show high mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy, especially in regions more susceptible to oxidative damage, such as the displacement loop, and that the degree of heteroplasmy will be correlated with the severity of ischemia and mobility impairment. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mitochondrial mutations and deletions and their relative abundance were identified by targeted mi-tochondrial DNA sequencing in biopsy specimens of gastrocnemius muscle from 33 PAD (ankle brachial index <0.9) and 9 non-PAD (ankle brachial index >0.9) subjects aged ≥60 years. The probability of heteroplasmy per DNA base was significantly higher for PAD subjects than non-PAD within each region. In adjusted models, PAD was associated with higher heteroplasmy than non-PAD (P=0.003), but the association was limited to microheteroplasmy, that is heteroplasmy found in 1% to 5% of all mitochondrial genomes (P=0.004). Heteroplasmy in the displacement loop and coding regions were significantly higher for PAD than non-PAD subjects after adjustment for age, sex, race, and diabetes mellitus (P=0.037 and 0.004, respectively). Low mitochondrial damage, defined by both low mitochondrial DNA copy number and low microheteroplasmy, was associated with better walking performance. CONCLUSIONS: People with PAD have higher “low frequency” heteroplasmy in gastrocnemius muscle compared with people without PAD. Among people with PAD, those who had evidence of least mitochondrial damage, had better walking performance than those with more mitochondrial damage.

The imprinted and developmentally regulated long noncoding RNA H19 is involved in many cell processes and diseases. Here, we investigated the role of H19 in regulating Paneth and goblet cells and autophagy, and its impact on intestinal barrier dysfunction induced by septic stress. Methods: Studies were conducted in H19-deficient (H19-/-) mice, mucosal tissues from patients with sepsis, primary enterocytes, and Caco-2 cells. Septic stress was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and gut permeability was detected by tracer fluorescein isothiocyanate–dextran assays. The function of Paneth and goblet cells was examined by immunostaining for lysozyme and mucin 2, respectively, and autophagy was examined by microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3 II immunostaining and Western blot analysis. Intestinal organoids were isolated from H19-/- and control littermate mice and treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Results: Intestinal mucosal tissues in mice 24 hours after exposure to CLP and in patients with sepsis showed high H19 levels, associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction. Targeted deletion of the H19 gene in mice enhanced the function of Paneth and goblet cells and promoted autophagy in the small intestinal mucosa. Knockout of H19 protected Paneth and goblet cells against septic stress, preserved autophagy activation, and promoted gut barrier function after exposure to CLP. Compared with organoids from control littermate mice, intestinal organoids isolated from H19-/- mice had increased numbers of lysozyme- and mucin 2–positive cells and showed increased tolerance to LPS. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of H19 in cultured intestinal epithelial cells prevented rapamycin-induced autophagy and abolished the rapamycin-induced protection of the epithelial barrier against LPS. Conclusions: In investigations of mice, human tissues, primary organoids, and intestinal epithelial cells, we found that increased H19 inhibited the function of Paneth and goblet cells and suppressed autophagy, thus potentially contributing to barrier dysfunction in intestinal pathologies.",Autophagy | Goblet cells | Gut permeability | Long Noncoding RNAs | Mucosal Defense | Paneth Cells,NA

Objective: Examine the relationship between head injury and later cognitive impairment. Methods: A sample of 3,123 Japanese-American men was assessed for history of head injury and evaluated for cognitive impairment using the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI). For a subsample of 676 respondents, neuropathologic results from those with and without head injury were compared. Results: Although the crude model showed an association between history of head injury and later severe cognitive impairment, the relationship lost significance in the adjusted model (OR=1.320, CI: 0.90-1.93), regardless of time between injury and impairment. Similar to cognitive impairment, hippocampal sclerosis was observed significantly more in the brains of respondents with a history of head injury in the crude model, but the relationship weakened in the adjusted model (OR=1.462, CI: 0.68-3.12). After adjustment, decedents with a head injury demonstrated marginally higher brain weight (OR=1.003, CI: 1.00-1.01). Conclusion: We did not find a relationship between head injury and subsequent cognitive decline in this cohort. The neuropathology results also displayed no strong association between history of head injury and specific brain lesions and characteristics. These results support other findings in prospective cohorts.

Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal study to examine whether PM2.5 affects the episodic memory decline, and also explored the potential mediating role of increased neuroanatomic risk of Alzheimer's disease associated with exposure. Participants included older females (n = 998; aged 73-87) enrolled in both the Women's Health Initiative Study of Cognitive Aging and the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, with annual (1999-2010) episodic memory assessment by the California Verbal Learning Test, including measures of immediate free recall/new learning (List A Trials 1-3; List B) and delayed free recall (shortand long-delay), and up to two brain scans (MRI-1: 2005-06; MRI-2: 2009-10). Subjects were assigned Alzheimer's disease pattern similarity scores (a brain-MRI measured neuroanatomical risk for Alzheimer's disease), developed by supervised machine learning and validated with data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Based on residential histories and environmental data on air monitoring and simulated atmospheric chemistry, we used a spatiotemporal model to estimate 3-year average PM2.5 exposure preceding MRI-1. In multilevel structural equation models, PM2.5 was associated with greater declines in immediate recall and new learning, but no association was found with decline in delayed-recall or composite scores. For each interquartile increment (2.81 μg/m3) of PM2.5, the annual decline rate was significantly accelerated by 19.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.9% to 36.2%] for Trials 1-3 and 14.8% (4.4% to 24.9%) for List B performance, adjusting for multiple potential confounders.

Lowering high blood pressure with specific antihypertensive medications (AHMs) could reduce the burden of disease. We investigated whether specific AHM classes reduced the risk for dementia. Methods: We did a meta-analysis of individual participant data from eligible observational studies published between Jan 1, 1980, and Jan 1, 2019. Cohorts were eligible for inclusion if they prospectively recruited community-dwelling adults; included more than 2000 participants; collected data for dementia events over at least 5 years; had measured blood pressure and verified use of AHMs; included in-person exams, supplemented with additional data, to capture dementia events; and had followed up cases for mortality. We assessed the association of incident dementia and clinical Alzheimer's disease with use of five AHM classes, within strata of baseline high (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥90 mm Hg) and normal (SBP <140 mm Hg and DBP <90 mm Hg) blood pressure. We used a propensity score to control for confounding factors related to the probability of receiving AHM. Study-specific effect estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. Results: Six prospective community-based studies (n=31 090 well phenotyped dementia-free adults older than 55 years) with median follow-ups across cohorts of 7–22 years were eligible for analysis. There were 3728 incident cases of dementia and 1741 incident Alzheimer's disease diagnoses. In the high blood pressure stratum (n=15 537), those using any AHM had a reduced risk for developing dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 0·88, 95% CI 0·79–0·98; p=0·019) and Alzheimer's disease (HR 0·84, 0·73–0·97; p=0·021) compared with those not using AHM. We did not find any significant differences between one drug class versus all others on risk of dementia. In the normal blood pressure stratum (n=15 553), there was no association between AHM use and incident dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Interpretation: Over a long period of observation, no evidence was found that a specific AHM drug class was more effective than others in lowering risk of dementia. Among people with hypertensive levels of blood pressure, use of any AHM with efficacy to lower blood pressure might reduce the risk for dementia.

All participants are assessed annually with a battery of motor and non-motor scales, 123-I Ioflupane dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging, and biological variables. We aimed to examine whether non-manifesting carriers of LRRK2 and GBA mutations have prodromal features of Parkinson's disease that correlate with reduced DAT binding. Methods: This cross-sectional analysis is based on assessments done at enrolment in the subset of non-manifesting carriers of LRRK2 and GBA mutations enrolled into the PPMI study from 33 participating sites worldwide. The primary objective was to examine baseline clinical and DAT imaging characteristics in non-manifesting carriers with GBA and LRRK2 mutations compared with healthy controls. DAT deficit was defined as less than 65% of putamen striatal binding ratio expected for the individual's age. We used t tests, χ2 tests, and Fisher's exact tests to compare baseline demographics across groups. An inverse probability weighting method was applied to control for potential confounders such as age and sex. To account for multiple comparisons, we applied a family-wise error rate to each set of analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01141023. Findings: Between Jan 1, 2014, and Jan 1, 2019, the study enrolled 208 LRRK2 (93% G2019S) and 184 GBA (96% N370S) non-manifesting carriers. Both groups were similar with respect to mean age, and about 60% were female. Of the 286 (73%) non-manifesting carriers that had DAT imaging results, 18 (11%) LRRK2 and four (3%) GBA non-manifesting carriers had a DAT deficit. Compared with healthy controls, both LRRK2 and GBA non-manifesting carriers had significantly increased mean scores on the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (total score 4·6 [SD 4·4] healthy controls vs 8·4 [7·3] LRRK2 vs 9·5 [9·2] GBA, p<0·0001 for both comparisons) and the Scale for Outcomes for PD – autonomic function (5·8 [3·7] vs 8·1 [5·9] and 8·4 [6·0], p<0·0001 for both comparisons). There was no difference in daytime sleepiness, anxiety, depression, impulsive–compulsive disorders, blood pressure, urate, and rapid eye movement (REM) behaviour disorder scores. Hyposmia was significantly more common only in LRRK2 non-manifesting carriers (69 [36%] of 194 healthy controls vs 114 [55%] of 208 LRRK2 non-manifesting carriers; p=0·0003). Finally, GBA but not LRRK2 non-manifesting carriers showed increased DAT striatal binding ratios compared with healthy controls in the caudate (healthy controls 2·98 [SD 0·63] vs GBA 3·26 [0·63]; p<0·0001), putamen (2·15 [0·56] vs 2·48 [0·52]; p<0·0001), and striatum (2·56 [0·57] vs 2·87 [0·55]; p<0·0001). Interpretation: Our data show evidence of subtle motor and non-motor signs of Parkinson's disease in non-manifesting carriers compared with healthy controls that can precede DAT deficit.

In two cohort studies, slow gait speed predicted transitioning from mild to severe cognitive impairment (InCHIANTI: HR = 2.08, 95%CI = 1.40–3.07; LASA: HR = 1.33, 95%CI = 1.01–1.75) and transitioning from a cognitively healthy state to death (H70: HR = 3.30, 95%CI = 1.74–6.28; LASA: HR = 1.70, 95%CI = 1.30–2.21). Conclusions: Screening for slow gait speed may be useful for identifying older adults at risk of adverse outcomes such as cognitive decline and death. However, once in the stage of more advanced cognitive impairment, slow gait speed does not seem to predict transitioning to death anymore.",Cognition | Dementia | Multistate modeling | Walking speed,110783

Method: Participants were 325 African American and White urban-dwelling adults (M age = 47.9 years; 49.5% African American; 50.2% female; 48.9% living in poverty) from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study. TL was assayed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using quantitative polymerase chain reactions. Multivariable regression analyses examined interactions of TL, poverty status, and race with performance on the following cognitive tests: Trail-Making Test Parts A and B, Digit Span Forward and Backward, semantic verbal fluency, Brief Test of Attention, Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT), and California Verbal Learning Test-II total learning, short-delay free recall, and long-delay free recall scores. Analyses adjusted for age, sex, and high school-or-greater educational attainment. Results: Significant three-way interactions of TL × Poverty Status × Race revealed that, among White participants living in poverty, shorter TL was associated with worse performance on Digit Span Forward and Backward (ps<.05). Additionally, significant two-way interactions of TL × Poverty Status revealed that, among all participants living in poverty, shorter TL was associated with worse performance on the Trail-Making Test Part B and the BVRT (ps<.05). Conclusions: TL may be differentially associated with aspects of attention, executive functioning, and memory among individuals living in poverty, who may be uniquely vulnerable to adverse effects of shorter telomeres. Replication of these findings is needed to determine their generalizability. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) General Scientific Summary—In this study, we found that associations between peripheral blood mononuclear cell telomere length and cognitive test performance among those living in poverty, particularly Whites. Our findings suggest that poverty, particularly among Whites, may confer greater vulnerability to adverse effects of shortened telomere length on neurocognitive health. Ultimately, further clarification of the biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying sociodemographic health disparities may pave the way for the prevention and treatment of premature cognitive aging and disease.

The receptor for GDF-15 was recently identified in the brainstem and regulates food intake and metabolism. The relationship of plasma GDF-15 with the age-associated decline of muscle mass and strength, gait speed, and physical performance in adults has not been well characterized. Methods: Plasma GDF-15, grip strength, 6-m gait speed, 400-m walking test time, lower extremity physical performance score, appendicular lean mass, and fat mass were measured in 194 healthy adult participants, aged 22-93 years, of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Results: Plasma GDF-15 concentrations increased with age (p < .001) and were higher in whites compared with blacks and Asians (p = .04). Adults with higher plasma GDF-15 had slower 6-m gait speed, longer 400-m walking time, and lower physical performance score in multivariable analyses adjusting for age and race. Plasma GDF-15 was not associated with grip strength, appendicular lean mass, or fat mass. Conclusions: Elevated plasma GDF-15 is associated with slower gait speed, higher 400-m walking time, and lower physical performance in very healthy community-dwelling adults. The relationship between plasma GDF-15 and sarcopenia-related outcomes may be stronger in the population not selected to be healthy, and this hypothesis should be tested in a representative population.",Aging | Growth and differentiation factor 15 | Physical performance | Sarcopenia | Skeletal muscle,NA

They arise from linear precursor RNAs in which 5′ and 3′ ends become covalently ligated. Given these features, biochemical and computational approaches traditionally used to study linear RNA must be adapted for analysis of circular RNAs. Such circRNA-specific methodologies are allowing the systematic identification of circRNAs and the analysis of their biological functions. Here, we review the resources and molecular methods currently utilized to quantify circRNAs, visualize their distribution, identify interacting partners, and elucidate their function. We discuss the challenges of analyzing circRNAs and propose alternative approaches for studying this unique class of transcripts.
