Despite advances in prevention and treatment, in particular through reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels2, heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide3. Genome-wideassociation studies (GWAS) of blood lipid levels have led to important biological and clinical insights, as well as new drug targets, for cardiovascular disease. However, most previous GWAS4–23 have been conducted in European ancestry populations and may have missed genetic variants that contribute to lipid-level variation in other ancestry groups. These include differences in allele frequencies, effect sizes and linkage-disequilibrium patterns24. Here we conduct a multi-ancestry, genome-wide genetic discovery meta-analysis of lipid levels in approximately 1.65 million individuals, including 350,000 of non-European ancestries. We quantify the gain in studying non-European ancestries and provide evidence to support the expansion of recruitment of additional ancestries, even with relatively small sample sizes. We find that increasing diversity rather than studying additional individuals of European ancestry results in substantial improvements in fine-mapping functional variants and portability of polygenic prediction (evaluated in approximately 295,000 individuals from 7 ancestry groupings). Modest gains in the number of discovered loci and ancestry-specific variants were also achieved. As GWAS expand emphasis beyond the identification of genes and fundamental biology towards the use of genetic variants for preventive and precision medicine25, we anticipate that increased diversity of participants will lead to more accurate and equitable26 application of polygenic scores in clinical practice.",456,34887591,Journal,ar,Article,100,524,100,21206,TPUSA,I01BX004821,Merck,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,1,NA,NA,NA

Epigenetic age acceleration has been shown to be predictive of many age-associated diseases and mortality. However, the association between epigenetic age acceleration and hearing remains unknown. Our study aims to investigate the relationship between epigenetic age acceleration and audiometric hearing in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). Methods: Participants with both DNA methylation and audiometric hearing measurements were included. The main independent variables are epigenetic age acceleration measures, including intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration—“IEAA,” Hannum age acceleration—“AgeAccelerationResidualHannum,” PhenoAge acceleration—“AgeAccelPheno,” GrimAge acceleration—“AgeAccelGrim,” and methylation-based pace of aging estimation—“DunedinPoAm.” The main dependent variable is speech-frequency pure tone average. Linear regression was used to assess the association between epigenetic age acceleration and hearing. Results: Among the 236 participants (52.5% female), after adjusting for age, sex, race, time difference between measurements, cardiovascular factors, and smoking history, the effect sizes were 0.11 995% CI: (–0.00, 0.23), p = 0.054] for Hannum’s clock, 0.08 [95% CI: (–0.03, 0.19), p = 0.143] for Horvath’s clock, 0.10 [95% CI: (–0.01, 0.21), p = 0.089] for PhenoAge, 0.20 [95% CI: (0.06, 0.33), p = 0.004] for GrimAge, and 0.21 [95% CI: (0.09, 0.33), p = 0.001] for DunedinPoAm.

However, the molecular mechanism by which TDP-43 aggregates form and cause neurodegeneration remains poorly understood. Cyclophilin A, also known as peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A (PPIA), is a foldase and molecular chaperone. We previously found that PPIA interacts with TDP-43 and governs some of its functions, and its deficiency accelerates disease in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Here we characterized PPIA knock-out mice throughout their lifespan and found that they develop a neurodegenerative disease with key behavioural features of frontotemporal dementia, marked TDP-43 pathology and late-onset motor dysfunction. In the mouse brain, deficient PPIA induces mislocalization and aggregation of the GTP-binding nuclear protein Ran, a PPIA interactor and a master regulator of nucleocytoplasmic transport, also for TDP-43. Moreover, in absence of PPIA, TDP-43 autoregulation is perturbed and TDP-43 and proteins involved in synaptic function are downregulated, leading to impairment of synaptic plasticity. Finally, we found that PPIA was downregulated in several patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal dementia, and identified a PPIA loss-of-function mutation in a patient with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The mutant PPIA has low stability, altered structure and impaired interaction with TDP-43. These findings strongly implicate that defective PPIA function causes TDP-43 mislocalization and dysfunction and should be considered in future therapeutic approaches.",17,34972208,Journal,ar,Article,100,21,21,14317,UKRI,104815,UK Research and Innovation,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,6,ALS | FTD | mouse model | nucleocytoplasmic transport | Ran | TDP-43 pathology,NA,NA

The unique social structures and contexts of Hispanics/Latinos in the U.S. may influence such relationships. This study evaluated whether unhealthy behaviors weakened the relationship between allostatic load, a measure of chronic stress, and future elevated depressive symptoms among Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos participants. Methods: Longitudinal data (2008–2011 and 2014–2017) from 11,623 participants were analyzed. The exposure was allostatic load, an index of twelve established biomarkers categorized using clinically relevant cut points, at Visit 1. Elevated depressive symptoms were operationalized as a score of ≥10 (out of 30) on the CES-D 10 at Visit 2. An index of unhealthy behaviors, with one point each for cigarette smoking, excessive/binge drinking, sedentary behavior, and poor diet quality at Visit 1, was examined as an effect modifier. Multivariable logistic regression, in the overall sample and among Mexicans specifically and adjusted for demographic characteristics and elevated depressive symptoms at Visit 1, was used to model allostatic load, unhealthy behavior index (range: 0–4), and their interaction in relation to elevated depressive symptoms at Visit 2. Results: Overall, greater allostatic load was associated with higher odds of elevated depressive symptoms after at least 6 years (aOR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.10).

Participants 7483 European-ancestry adults from the UK Biobank study with genetic and linked primary care data, aged 36-79 years at time of first clopidogrel prescription. Interventions Clopidogrel prescription in primary care, mean duration 2.6 years (range 2 months to 18 years). Main outcome measure Hospital inpatient-diagnosed ischaemic stroke, MI or angina while treated with clopidogrel. Results 28.7% of participants carried at least one CYP2C19 LoF variant. LoF carriers had higher rates of incident ischaemic stroke while treated with clopidogrel compared with those without the variants (8 per 1000 person-years vs 5.2 per 1000 person-years; HR 1.53, 95% CIs 1.04 to 2.26, p=0.031).

These cellular and tissue remodeling is the fertile soil for the development of age-associated structural and functional disorders in the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems in the pathogenesis of obesity, type II diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, heart dysfunction, and cognitive decline. Growing evidence indicates that puerarin, a polyphenol, extracted from Puerara Labota, efficiently alleviates the initiation and progression of obesity, type II diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, cardiac ischemia, cardiac arrythmia, cardiac hypertrophy, ischemic stroke, and cognition decline via suppression of oxidative stress and inflammation.

Age-related cataracts affect the majority of older adults and are a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Treatments that delay cataract onset or severity have the potential to delay cataract surgery, but require relevant animal models that recapitulate the major types of cataracts for their development. Unfortunately, few such models are available. Here, we report the lens phenotypes of aged mice lacking the critical antioxidant transcription factor Nfe2l2 (designated as Nrf2 −/−). METHODS. Three independent cohorts of Nrf2 −/− and wild-type C57BL/6J mice were evaluated for cataracts using combinations of slit lamp imaging, photography of freshly dissected lenses, and histology. Mice were fed high glycemic diets, low glycemic diets, regular chow ad libitum, or regular chow with 30% caloric restriction. RESULTS. Nrf2 −/− mice developed significant opacities between 11 and 15 months and developed advanced cortical, posterior subcapsular, anterior subcapsular, and nuclear cataracts. Cataracts occurred similarly in male mice fed high or low glycemic diets, and were also observed in 21-month male and female Nrf2 −/− mice fed ad libitum or 30% caloric restriction. Histological observation of 18-month cataractous lenses revealed significant disruption to fiber cell architecture and the retention of nuclei throughout the cortical region of the lens. However, fiber cell denucleation and initiation of lens differentiation was normal at birth, with the first abnormalities observed at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS. Nrf2 −/− mice offer a tool to understand how defective antioxidant signaling causes multiple forms of cataract and may be useful for screening drugs to prevent or delay cataractogenesis in susceptible adults.",13,34882206,Journal,ar,Article,100,17,17,13945,NIH,2016-08885,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,16,Age-related cataract | Antioxidant | Caloric restriction | Glycemic index | Nutrition,10,NA

Objectives: The aim was to investigate whether changes in neural targets in the negative affect circuit following psychotherapy mediate subsequent changes in weight and behaviors. Methods: Adults (n = 108) with obesity and depression were randomly assigned to usual care or an intervention that delivered problem-solving therapy (PST) for depression over 2 mo. fMRI for brain imaging was performed at baseline and 2 mo. BMI, physical activity, and diet were measured at baseline and 12 mo. Mediation analysis assessed between-group differences in neural target changes using t test and correlations between neural target changes and outcome changes (simple and interaction effect) using ordinary least-squares regression. Results: Compared with usual care, PST led to reductions in left amygdala activation (-0.75; 95% CI:-1.49,-0.01) and global scores of the negative affect circuit (-0.43;-0.81,-0.06), engaged by threat stimuli. Increases in amygdala activation and global circuit scores at 2 mo correlated with decreases in physical activity outcomes at 12 mo in the usual-care group; these relations were altered by PST. In relation to change in leisure-Time physical activity, standardized β-coefficients were-0.67 in usual care and-0.01 in the intervention (between-group difference: 0.66; 0.02, 1.30) for change in left amygdala activation and-2.02 in usual care and-0.11 in the intervention (difference: 1.92; 0.64, 3.20) for change in global circuit scores.

However, obesity rates remain at historic highs, despite a persistent focus on eating less and moving more, as guided by the energy balance model (EBM). This public health failure may arise from a fundamental limitation of the EBM itself. Conceptualizing obesity as a disorder of energy balance restates a principle of physics without considering the biological mechanisms that promote weight gain. An alternative paradigm, the carbohydrate-insulin model (CIM), proposes a reversal of causal direction. According to the CIM, increasing fat deposition in the body-resulting from the hormonal responses to a high-glycemic-load diet-drives positive energy balance. The CIM provides a conceptual framework with testable hypotheses for how various modifiable factors influence energy balance and fat storage.

We aimed to study the association of long-terms trajectories of body mass index (BMI) with contemporaneous changes in multimorbidity −and multimorbidity type− development in a population-based cohort of older adults. Methods: Twelve-year BMI trajectories (2001–2013) were identified in subjects aged 60+ years from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K) using growth mixture models (N = 2189). Information on 60 chronic diseases and multimorbidity was ascertained based on clinical examinations, lab tests, medications, and inpatient and outpatient medical records. Linear mixed models were used to study the association between BMI trajectories and the speed of chronic disease accumulation, in general and by groups of cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric diseases. Results: Eighty percent of the study population was included in what we defined a stable BMI trajectory, 18% in a slow-decline trajectory with an accelerated BMI decline from age 78 onwards, and 2% in a fast-decline trajectory that reached underweight values before age 85. A significantly higher yearly rate of chronic disease accumulation was observed in the fast-decline versus stable trajectory (β = 0.221, 95% CI 0.090–0.352) after adjusting the model for age cohort, sex, education and time to death. Subjects in the slow-decline trajectory showed a significantly higher yearly rate of cardiovascular disease accumulation (β = 0.016, 95% CI 0.000–0.031); those in the fast-decline trajectory showed a faster accumulation of both cardiovascular (β = 0.020, 95% CI -0.025, 0.064) and neuropsychiatric diseases (β = 0.102, 95% CI 0.064–0.139), even if the former association did not reach statistical significance.

The epidemiological data available, however, are mainly based on the physical frailty phenotype. An extensive literature has suggested that frailty should be identified using a multidimensional approach. Based on these recommendations, we estimated the prevalence of frailty and pre-frailty in the older population, using the multidimensional prognostic index (MPI), a common tool for defining multidimensional frailty. We searched several databases until 10th May 2021 for studies reporting the prevalence of frailty according to MPI values.

Increased use of FDA approved GLP-1 analogues for treating metabolic disorders and neurodegenerative diseases raises interest in GLP-1 (9-36)’s biological role. We use human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and a GLP-1R over-expressing variety (#9), in both undifferentiated and differentiated states, to evaluate the neurotrophic/neuroprotective effects of GLP-1 (9-36) against toxic glutamate exposure and other oxidative stress models (via the MTS, LDH or ROS assays).

Examine to what extent baseline measures of volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD), absolute bone mineral content (BMC), and markers of physical function may explain incident hip fractures in older adults with different serum levels of 25(OH)D. A prospective study of 4309 subjects (≥66 years) recruited between 2002 and 2006 into the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik (AGES-Reykjavik) study. Hip fractures occurring until the end of 2012 were extracted from hospital records. Prevalence of serum 25(OH)D deficiency (<30 nmol/L), inadequacy (30–<50 nmol/L), and sufficiency (≥50 nmol/L) was 6%, 23%, and 71% for males; and 11%, 28%, and 53% for females, respectively. Female participants had ~30% lower absolute BMC compared to males. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were positively associated with vBMD and BMC of the femoral neck and markers of physical function, including leg strength and balance. Those who had deficient compared to sufficient status at baseline had a higher age-adjusted risk of incidence hipfractures with hazard ratios (HRs) of 3.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9–5.2) and 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3–2.5) among males and females, respectively.

We identified ELAVL3 as one of the most downregulated genes in our transcriptome profiles of laser captured microdissection of motor neurons from sporadic ALS nervous systems and the most dysregulated of all RBPs. Neuropathological characterizations showed ELAVL3 nuclear depletion in a great percentage of remnant motor neurons, sometimes accompanied by cytoplasmic accumulations. These abnormalities were common in sporadic cases with and without intermediate expansions in ATXN2 and familial cases carrying mutations in C9orf72 and SOD1. Depletion of ELAVL3 occurred at both the RNA and protein levels and a short protein isoform was identified, but it is not related to a TDP-43-dependent cryptic exon in intron 3. Strikingly, ELAVL3 abnormalities were more frequent than TDP-43 abnormalities and occurred in motor neurons still with normal nuclear TDP-43 present, but all neurons with abnormal TDP-43 also had abnormal ELAVL3. In a neuron-like cell culture model using SH-SY5Y cells, ELAVL3 mislocalization occurred weeks before TDP-43 abnormalities were seen.

Seven hundred and thirty-four participants with baseline 18F-AV-1451 tau PET (baseline age 73.9 ± 7.7 years, 375 female) were stratified into five stages by a topographic PET staging scheme. Cognitive trajectories and clinical progression were compared across stages with or without further dichotomy of amyloid status, using linear mixed-effect models and Cox proportional hazard models. Significant cognitive decline was first observed in stage 1 when tau levels only increased in transentorhinal regions. Rates of cognitive decline and clinical progression accelerated from stage 2 to stage 3 and stage 4. Higher stages were also associated with greater CSF phosphorylated tau and total tau concentrations from stage 1. Abnormal tau accumulation did not appear with normal β-amyloid in neocortical regions but prompt cognitive decline by interacting with β-amyloid in temporal regions. Highly accumulated tau in temporal regions independently led to cognitive deterioration.

Simulated datasets are an invaluable tool to accurately assess the performance of RNA-Seq analysis methods. However, existing RNA-Seq simulators focus on modeling the technical biases and artifacts of sequencing, rather than on simulating the original RNA samples. A first step in simulating RNA-Seq is to simulate RNA. Results: To fill this need, we developed the Configurable And Modular Program Allowing RNA Expression Emulation (CAMPAREE), a simulator using empirical data to simulate diploid RNA samples at the level of individual molecules. We demonstrated CAMPAREE’s use for generating idealized coverage plots from real data, and for adding the ability to generate allele-specific data to existing RNA-Seq simulators that do not natively support this feature. Conclusions: Separating input sample modeling from library preparation/sequencing offers added flexibility for both users and developers to mix-and-match different sample and sequencing simulators to suit their specific needs. Furthermore, the ability to maintain sample and sequencing simulators independently provides greater agility to incorporate new biological findings about transcriptomics and new developments in sequencing technologies. Additionally, by simulating at the level of individual molecules, CAMPAREE has the potential to model molecules transcribed from the same genes as a heterogeneous population of transcripts with different states of degradation and processing (splicing, editing, etc.).

Applying this approach to complex traits reveals that forward effects have negligible contribution.

Aims: Here we verified if the combined evaluation of aminotransferases may improve risk stratification for adverse outcomes in older patients. Methods: Data are from 761 participants aged more than 65 years from a prospective population-based database (InCHIANTI study), without known baseline chronic liver disease or malignancies. Associations between aminotransferase levels and the risk of all-cause, cardiovascular- and cancer-death were assessed by Cox-models with time-dependent covariates. Results: The association of ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) with mortality was non-linear, mirroring a J- and a U-shaped curve, respectively.

However, despite considerable research in statistical methods for association testing with microbiome data, approaches that are generally applicable remain elusive. Classical tests often do not accommodate the realities of microbiome data, leading to power loss. Approaches tailored for microbiome data depend highly upon the normalization strategies used to handle differential read depth and other data characteristics, and they often have unacceptably high false positive rates, generally due to unsatisfied distributional assumptions. On the other hand, many non-parametric tests suffer from loss of power and may also present difficulties in adjusting for potential covariates. Most extant approaches also fail in the presence of heterogeneous effects. The field needs new non-parametric approaches that are tailored to microbiome data, robust to distributional assumptions, and powerful under heterogeneous effects, while permitting adjustment for covariates. Methods: As an alternative to existing approaches, we propose a zero-inflated quantile approach (ZINQ), which uses a two-part quantile regression model to accommodate the zero inflation in microbiome data. For a given taxon, ZINQ consists of a valid test in logistic regression to model the zero counts, followed by a series of quantile rank-score based tests on multiple quantiles of the non-zero part with adjustment for the zero inflation. As a regression and quantile-based approach, the method is non-parametric and robust to irregular distributions, while providing an allowance for covariate adjustment. Since no distributional assumptions are made, ZINQ can be applied to data that has been processed under any normalization strategy. Results: Thorough simulations based on real data across a range of scenarios and application to real data sets show that ZINQ often has equivalent or higher power compared to existing tests even as it offers better control of false positives. Conclusions: We present ZINQ, a quantile-based association test between microbiota and dichotomous or quantitative clinical variables, providing a powerful and robust alternative for the current microbiome differential abundance analysis.

Compared to the least active women (mean, 3 min/day MVPA, 27 min/day HLPA, 162 min/day LLPA, and 701 min/day SB): compositional models showed an inverse L-shaped dose-response association of MVPA replacing other behaviors with mortality rates mortality rates (P =.02); SB relative to LLPA, HLPA, and MVPA was directly associated with mortality rates in a curvilinear dose-response manner (P <.001); replacing 10 min of SB for MVPA (HR (95% CI) =.86 (.73–.98)) or for HLPA (HR (95% CI.94 (.88–1.00)) associated with 14 and 6% lower mortality rates, respectively; a 47% risk reduction (HR [95% CI] =.53 [.42–.64]) was observed among women meeting physical activity guidelines (mean, 36 min/day MVPA, 79 min/day HLPA, 227 min/day LLPA and 549 min/day SB); and similar mortality rate reductions of 43% (HR (95% CI) =.57 (.41–.73)) were observed with increases in HLPA and LLPA without increasing MVPA, e.g., reallocating SB to 90 min/day of HLPA plus 120 min/day of LLPA. Conclusions: There was no “ideal” combination of physical activities of different intensities and SB associated with the lowest mortality rates. Of particular relevance to older women, replacing SB with light intensity activity was associated with lower mortality rates, and “mixing and matching” times in different intensities yielded equivalent mortality risk reductions.",11,34376213,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,14875,NIH,CA047988,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,54,NA,104,NA

Although the cause of AD is not yet known and there is no treatment to cure this disease, its progression can be delayed. AD has recently been recognized as a brain-specific type of diabetes called type 3 diabetes. Several studies have shown that people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have a higher risk of developing AD. Therefore, it is important to identify subgroups of patients with AD that may be more likely to be associated with T2D. We here describe a new approach to identify the correlation between AD and T2D at the genetic level. Subgroups of AD and T2D were each generated using a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) approach, which generated clusters containing subsets of genes and samples. In the gene cluster that was generated by conventional gene clustering method from NMF, we selected genes with significant differences in the corresponding sample cluster by Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn-test. Subsequently, we extracted differentially expressed gene (DEG) subgroups, and candidate genes with the same regulation direction can be extracted at the intersection of two disease DEG subgroups. Finally, we identified 241 candidate genes that represent common features related to both AD and T2D, and based on pathway analysis we propose that these genes play a role in the common pathological features of AD and T2D. Moreover, in the prediction of AD using logistic regression analysis with an independent AD dataset, the candidate genes obtained better prediction performance than DEGs. In conclusion, our study revealed a subgroup of patients with AD that are associated with T2D and candidate genes associated between AD and T2D, which can help in providing personalized and suitable treatments.",18,34315930,Journal,ar,Article,100,310,100,21100200805,J&amp;J,R03AG054936,Johnson and Johnson,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,55,NA,15265,NA

It is highly effective against several types of tumours; however, it also has adverse effects on regenerative populations of normal cells, such as human cardiac mesenchymal progenitor cells (hCmPCs), and its clinical use is limited by cardiotoxicity. Another known effect of Dox is nucleolar disruption, which triggers the ubiquitously expressed nucleolar phosphoprotein Nucleophosmin (NPM) to be released from the nucleolus into the cell, where it participates in the orchestration of cellular stress responses. NPM has also been observed in the extracellular space in response to different stress stimuli; however, the mechanism behind this and its functional implications are as yet largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to establish whether Dox could elicit NPM secretion in the extracellular space and to elucidate the mechanism of secretion and the effect of extracellular NPM on hCmPCs. Results: We found that following the double-strand break formation in hCmPCs caused by Dox, NPM was rapidly secreted in the extracellular space by an active mechanism, in the absence of either apoptosis or necrosis. Extracellular release of NPM was similarly seen in response to ultraviolet radiation (UV). Furthermore, we observed an increase of NPM levels in the plasma of Dox-treated mice; thus, NPM release also occurred in vivo. The treatment of hCmPCs with extracellular recombinant NPM induced a decrease of cell proliferation and a response mediated through the Toll-like receptor (TLR)4. We demonstrated that NPM binds to TLR4, and via TLR4, and nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB) activation/nuclear translocation, exerts proinflammatory functions by inducing IL-6 and COX-2 gene expression. Finally, we found that in hCmPCs, NPM secretion could be driven by an autophagy-dependent unconventional mechanism that requires TLR4, since TLR4 inhibition dramatically reduced Dox-induced secretion. Conclusions: We hypothesise that the extracellular release of NPM could be a general response to DNA damage since it can be elicited by either a chemical agent such as Dox or a physical genotoxic stressor such as UV radiation. Following genotoxic stress, NPM acts similarly to an alarmin in hCmPCs, being rapidly secreted and promoting cell cycle arrest and a TLR4/NFκB-dependent inflammatory response.",10,34134693,Journal,ar,Article,100,13,13,13096,NIH,RC2015/16,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,61,Alarmin | Anthracyclines | Cardiotoxicity | Doxorubicin | Ultraviolet radiation,124,NA

The defect in RAD51 loading is linked to a disbalance of BRCA1 and 53BP1 accumulation at stalled forks.

The functional significance of this Copper transporter was demonstrated by the finding that inducible EC-specific ATP7A deficient mice or ATP7A-dysfunctional ATP7Amut mice showed impaired post-ischemic neovascularization. In ECs, loss of ATP7A inhibited VEGF-induced VEGFR2 signaling and angiogenic responses, in part by promoting ligand-induced VEGFR2 protein degradation. Mechanistically, VEGF stimulated ATP7A translocation from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane where it bound to VEGFR2, which prevented autophagy-mediated lysosomal VEGFR2 degradation by inhibiting autophagic cargo/adapter p62/SQSTM1 binding to ubiquitinated VEGFR2. Enhanced autophagy flux due to ATP7A dysfunction in vivo was confirmed by autophagy reporter CAG-ATP7Amut -RFP-EGFP-LC3 transgenic mice.

Genome, transcriptome and pseudo alignment-based methods are included; and a simple approach is included as a baseline control. Conclusions: Salmon, kallisto, RSEM, and Cufflinks exhibit the highest accuracy on idealized data, while on more realistic data they do not perform dramatically better than the simple approach. We determine the structural parameters with the greatest impact on quantification accuracy to be length and sequence compression complexity and not so much the number of isoforms.

Electrophysiological analysis shows that high frequency head impacts cause chronic modification of the AMPA/NMDA ratio in neurons that underlie the changes to cognition. To demonstrate that synaptic adaptation is caused by head impact-induced glutamate release, we pretreated mice with memantine prior to head impact. Memantine prevents the development of the key transcriptomic and electrophysiological signatures of high frequency head impact, and averts cognitive dysfunction.

In addition, we provide an overview of the biological pathways through which chronic infection may contribute to Alzheimer’s disease. Recent Findings: Dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease is a leading cause of disability among older adults in developed countries, yet knowledge of the causative factors that promote Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis remains incomplete. Over the past several decades, numerous studies have demonstrated an association of chronic viral and bacterial infection with Alzheimer’s disease. Implicated infectious agents include numerous herpesviruses (HSV-1, HHV-6, HHV-7) and various gastric, enteric, and oral bacterial species, as well as Chlamydia pneumonia and multiple spirochetes. Summary: Evidence supports the association between multiple pathogens and Alzheimer’s disease risk. Whether these pathogens play a causal role in Alzheimer’s pathophysiology remains an open question. We propose that the host immune response to active or latent infection in the periphery or in the brain triggers or accelerates the Alzheimer’s disease processes, including the accumulation of amyloid-ß and pathogenic tau, and neuroinflammation.

Using three different murine transgenic models, we provide counterintuitive evidence that the AD progression requires B cells. Despite expression of the AD-fostering transgenes, the loss of B cells alone is sufficient to reduce Aβ plaque burden and disease-associated microglia.

However, the interplay between BAF and MLL4 in enhancer activation remains unclear. Using adipogenesis as a model system, we identify BAF as the major SWI/SNF complex that colocalizes with MLL4 and LDTFs on active enhancers and is required for cell differentiation. In contrast, the promoter enriched SWI/SNF complex PBAF is dispensable for adipogenesis. By depleting BAF subunits SMARCA4 (BRG1) and SMARCB1 (SNF5) as well as MLL4 in cells, we show that BAF and MLL4 reciprocally regulate each other’s binding on active enhancers before and during adipogenesis.

To address this question, here we have individually assessed the effects of SARS-CoV-2 variant-specific spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) mutations E484K, K417N, L452Q, L452R, N501Y, and T478K that characterize and differentiate several emerging variants. Despite the hundreds of apparently neutral mutations observed in the domains other than the RBD, we have shown that each RBD mutation site is differentially engaged in an interdomain allosteric network involving mutation sites from a distant domain, affecting interactions with the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). This allosteric network couples the residues of the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the RBD, which are modulated by the RBD-specific mutations and are capable of propagating mutation-induced perturbations between these domains through a combination of structural changes and effector-dependent modulations of dynamics. One key feature of this network is the inclusion of compensatory mutations segregated into three characteristically different clusters, where each cluster residue site is allosterically coupled with specific RBD mutation sites. Notably, each RBD mutation acted like a positive allosteric modulator; nevertheless, K417N was shown to have the largest effects among all of the mutations on the allostery and thereby holds the highest binding affinity with ACE2.

However, studies that have assessed this association have not considered that slow walking may have different causes, some of which are not necessarily associated with higher AD risk. Objective: To evaluate whether low activity fragmentation among older adults with slow gait speed indicates neurological causes of slow walking that put these individuals at higher risk of AD. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study performed survival analyses using data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Participants included 520 initially cognitively normal persons aged 60 years or older. New diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD were adjudicated during a mean (SD) follow-up of 7.3 (2.7) years. Initial assessment of gait speed and activity fragmentation occurred from January 3, 2007, to May 11, 2015, with follow-up completed on December 31, 2020. Data were analyzed from February 1 to May 15, 2021. Exposures: Gait speed for 6 m and activity fragmentation assessed by accelerometry. Main Outcomes and Measures: Associations of gait speed, activity fragmentation, and their interaction with incident MCI/AD were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for covariates. Results: Among the 520 participants (265 women [51.0%]; 125 Black participants [24.0%]; 367 White participants [70.6%]; mean [SD] age, 73 [8] years), MCI/AD developed in 64 participants.

At low activity fragmentation (-1 SD), each 0.05-m/s slower gait speed was associated with a 19% increase in hazard of developing MCI/AD (HR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.07-1.32]), whereas at higher activity fragmentation (+1 SD), gait speed was not associated with MCI/AD (HR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.93-1.10]).

The specific targets and functional consequences of RNF4 regulation in response to replication stress, however, have not been fully characterized. Here we demonstrated that RNF4 is required for the restart of DNA replication following prolonged hydroxyurea (HU)-induced replication stress. Contrary to its role in repair of γ-irradiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), our analysis revealed that RNF4 does not significantly impact recognition or repair of replication stress-associated DSBs. Rather, using DNA fiber assays, we found that the firing of new DNA replication origins, which is required for replication restart following prolonged stress, was inhibited in cells depleted of RNF4. We also provided evidence that RNF4 recognizes and ubiquitylates sumoylated Bloom syndrome DNA helicase BLM and thereby promotes its proteosome-mediated turnover at damaged DNA replication forks. Consistent with it being a functionally important RNF4 substrate, co-depletion of BLM rescued defects in the firing of new replication origins observed in cells depleted of RNF4 alone.

While impaired DNA damage repair has been studied extensively in FA-associated carcinogenesis in vivo, the oncogenic contribution of mitotic abnormalities secondary to FA pathway deficiency remains incompletely understood. To examine the role of mitotic dysregulation in FA pathway deficient malignancies, we genetically exacerbated the baseline mitotic defect in Fancc-/- mice by introducing heterozygosity of the key spindle assembly checkpoint regulator Mad2. Fancc-/-;Mad2+/- mice were viable, but died from acute myeloid leukemia (AML), thus recapitulating the high risk of myeloid malignancies in FA patients better than Fancc-/-mice.

Designed using information bottleneck theory, CALAMITI learns a globally disentangled latent space containing both anatomical and contrast information, which permits harmonization. In contrast to supervised harmonization methods, our approach does not need a sample population to be imaged across sites. Unlike traditional unsupervised harmonization approaches which often suffer from geometry shifts, CALAMITI better preserves anatomy by design.

However, the scientific literature on these associations shows inconsistent findings. Objective: To assess cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of baseline thyroid dysfunction with cognitive function and dementia. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicohort individual participant data analysis assessed 114267 person-years (median, 1.7-11.3 years) of follow-up for cognitive function and 525222 person-years (median, 3.8-15.3 years) for dementia between 1989 and 2017. Analyses on cognitive function included 21 cohorts comprising 38144 participants. Analyses on dementia included eight cohorts with a total of 2033 cases with dementia and 44573 controls. Data analysis was performed from December 2016 to January 2021. Exposures: Thyroid function was classified as overt hyperthyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism, euthyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, and overt hypothyroidism based on uniform thyrotropin cutoff values and study-specific free thyroxine values. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was global cognitive function, mostly measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination. Executive function, memory, and dementia were secondary outcomes. Analyses were first performed at study level using multivariable linear regression and multivariable Cox regression, respectively. The studies were combined with restricted maximum likelihood meta-analysis. To overcome the use of different scales, results were transformed to standardized mean differences. For incident dementia, hazard ratios were calculated. Results: Among 74565 total participants, 66567 (89.3%) participants had normal thyroid function, 577 (0.8%) had overt hyperthyroidism, 2557 (3.4%) had subclinical hyperthyroidism, 4167 (5.6%) had subclinical hypothyroidism, and 697 (0.9%) had overt hypothyroidism. The study-specific median age at baseline varied from 57 to 93 years; 42847 (57.5%) participants were women. Thyroid dysfunction was not associated with global cognitive function; the largest differences were observed between overt hypothyroidism and euthyroidism - cross-sectionally (-0.06 standardized mean difference in score; 95% CI, -0.20 to 0.08; P =.40) and longitudinally (0.11 standardized mean difference higher decline per year; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.23; P =.09). No consistent associations were observed between thyroid dysfunction and executive function, memory, or risk of dementia. Conclusions and Relevance: In this individual participant data analysis of more than 74000 adults, subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism were not associated with cognitive function, cognitive decline, or incident dementia. No rigorous conclusions can be drawn regarding the role of overt thyroid dysfunction in risk of dementia.

Furthermore, we examined the association of PTRHD1 with PD risk and AAO using summary statistics data from the most recent PD genome-wide association study meta-analyses. Our results show no association between PTRHD1 and PD risk or AAO. We conclude that PTRHD1 does not play a major role in PD in the European population.

Background: Translation of knowledge of SAN automaticity gleaned from animal studies to human dysrhythmias (e.g., “sick sinus” syndrome [SSS]) requiring electronic pacemaker insertion has been suboptimal, largely because heart rate varies widely across species. Methods: Subcellular Ca2+ releases, whole cell action potential (AP)–induced Ca2+ transients, and APs were recorded in isolated mouse, guinea pig, rabbit, and human SAN cells. Ca2+-Vm kinetic parameters during phases of AP cycles from their ignition to recovery were quantified. Results: Although both AP cycle lengths (APCLs) and Ca2+-Vm kinetic parameters during AP cycles differed across species by 10-fold, trans-species scaling of these during AP cycles and scaling of these to APCL in cells in vitro, electrocardiogram RR intervals in vivo, and body mass (BM) were self-similar (obeyed power laws) across species. Thus, APCL in vitro, heart rate in vivo, and BM of any species can be predicted by Ca2+-Vm kinetics during AP cycles in SAN cells measured in any single species in vitro. Conclusions: In designing optimal heart rate to match widely different BM and energy requirements from mice to humans, nature did not “reinvent pacemaker cell wheels,” but differentially scaled kinetics of gears that regulate the rates at which the “wheels spin.” This discovery will facilitate the development of novel pharmacological and biological pacemakers featuring a normal, wide-range rate regulation in animal models and the translation of these to humans to target recalcitrant human SSS.",10,33933406,Journal,ar,Article,100,9,9,21100415950,NIH,ZIAAG000598,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,112,action potentials | Ca  and Vm kinetic transitions 2+ | cardiac pacemaker cells | heart rate | long-range power law correlations | subcellular local Ca  releases 2+,NA,S2405500X21002000

Methods Federated pooled analysis of six prospective cohorts with device-measured time spent in different intensities of physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep following a standardised compositional Cox regression analysis. Participants 130 239 people from general population samples of adults (average age 54 years) from the UK, USA and Sweden. Main outcome All-cause mortality (follow-up 4.3-14.5 years). Results Studies using wrist and hip accelerometer provided statistically different results (I 2 =92.2%, Q-test p<0.001). There was no association between duration of sleep and all-cause mortality, HR=0.96 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.12). The proportion of time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity was significantly associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR=0.63 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.71) wrist; HR=0.93 (95% CI 0.87 to 0.98) hip).

ICI therapy has not benefitted EGFR mutant lung cancer. Herein, we employed stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) quantitative mass spec-trometry‐based proteomics to investigate potential immune escape molecular mechanisms in osi-mertinib resistant EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma by interrogating the alterations in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class I‐presented immunopeptidome, Class I‐interactome, and the whole cell proteome between isogenic osimertinib‐sensitive and ‐resistant human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Our study demonstrates an overall reduction in HLA class I‐presented immunopeptidome and downregulation of antigen presentation core complex (e.g., TAP1 and ERAP1/2) and immuno-proteasome in osimertinib resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells. Several key components in autoph-agy pathway are differentially altered. S100 proteins and SLC3A2 may play critical roles in reduced antigen presentation. Our dataset also includes ~1000 novel HLA class I interaction partners and hundreds of Class I‐presented immunopeptides in EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma. This large-scale unbiased proteomics study provides novel insights and potential mechanisms of immune evasion of EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma.",8,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,8,8,19700188419,NIH,undefined,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,125,Antigen presentation | HLA | Immune evasion | Immunopeptidome | Lung adenocarcinoma | Osimertinib resistance | Proteomics | SILAC,4977,NA

Here we investigated temporal changes in behavior, tissue structure, and transcriptomic profiles in a rat model of a surgical incision, using hyperalgesic behavioral tests, histological analyses, and next-generation RNA sequencing, respectively. The most rapidly (1 hour) expressed genes were the chemokines, Cxcl1 and Cxcl2. Consequently, infiltrating leukocytes were abundantly observed starting at 6 and peaking at 24 hours after incising which was supported by histological analysis and appearance of the neutrophil markers, S100a8 and S100a9. At this time, hyperalgesia was at a peak and overall transcriptional activity was most highly activated. At the 1-day timepoint, Nppb, coding for natriuretic peptide precursor B, was the most strongly upregulated gene and was localized by in situ hybridization to the epidermal keratinocytes at the margins of the incision. Nppb was basically unaffected in a peripheral inflammation model transcriptomic dataset. At the late phase of wound healing, five secreted, incision-specific peptidases, Mmp2, Aebp1, Mmp23, Adamts7, and Adamtsl1, showed increased expression, supporting the idea of a sustained tissue remodeling process.

Method: Data are from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (2012-2019). Using pure-tone audiometry, we categorized hearing into normal, mild, and moderate or greater HI. Physical function was assessed with the expanded Short Physical Performance Battery (eSPPB) and walking endurance with time to walk 400 m. Multivariable and mixed-effects linear models tested the hypotheses that participants with HI, at baseline, have poorer physical performance and walking endurance, and faster decline over time (up to 6 measurements). In a subset (n = 526), we further adjusted for vestibular function. Among participants with HI, we evaluated the differences in eSPPB scores and walking endurance between hearing aid users and nonusers. Results: Of 831 participants, 26% had mild, and 17% moderate or greater HI. After adjustment for demographics and medical history, moderate or greater impairment versus normal hearing was associated with poorer function (0.17 [95% CI: 0.09, 0.26] lower eSPPB score, and 13.3 [95% CI: 3.31, 23.4] seconds slower 400-m walk time) and faster decline in these parameters over 6 years. Adjustment for vestibular function did not attenuate these associations. Hearing aid users walked 400 m 24 seconds faster than nonusers (p =. 001).

However, our data also suggest that more effective protein folding contributes to the augmented levels of PC2. We demonstrate that the unfolded protein response is activated in Pkd1 knockout kidneys and in Pkd1 mutant cells and that this is coupled with increased levels of GRP94, an endoplasmic reticulum protein that is a member of the HSP90 family of chaperones. GRP94 was found to physically interact with PC2 and depletion or chemical inhibition of GRP94 led to a decrease in PC2, suggesting that GRP94 serves as its chaperone. Moreover, GRP94 is acetylated and binds to histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a known deacetylase and activator of HSP90 proteins. Inhibition of HDAC6 decreased PC2 suggesting that HDAC6 and GRP94 work together to regulate PC2 levels. Lastly, we showed that inhibition of GRP94 prevents cAMP-induced cyst formation in vitro.

Results: α-Syn deposition varied as a function of genotype (F = 16.7, P < 0.0001). It was above the control range in 100% of subjects with SNCA mutations, 100% with LRRK2 mutations, 95% with idiopathic PD, 83% with GBA mutations, and 0% with biallelic PRKN mutations. α-Syn deposition in the biallelic PRKN group was significantly higher than in the control group. In addition, patients with biallelic PRKN mutations had higher α-syn deposition than their unaffected siblings. Conclusions: Individuals with SNCA, DJ-1, LRRK2, or GBA mutations have substantial intraneuronal α-syn deposition in sympathetic noradrenergic nerves in skin biopsies, whereas those with biallelic PRKN mutations do not.

This study also investigated associations of amounts of daily sustained PA with 6-minute walk (6MW) distance and the Short Form-36 physical functioning domain (SF-36 PF) score in cross-sectional analyses and with serious adverse events (SAEs) in longitudinal analyses of people with PAD. PA was measured continuously for 10 days using a tri-axial accelerometer at baseline in 277 participants with PAD randomized to the LITE clinical trial. In regression analyses, each 0.15 lower ABI value was associated with a 5.67% decrease in the number of daily bouts of sustained PA (95% CI: 3.85–6.54; p < 0.001). Every additional bout of sustained PA per day was associated with a 4.56-meter greater 6MW distance (95% CI: 2.67–6.46; p < 0.0001), and a 0.81-point improvement in SF-36 PF score (95% CI: 0.34–1.28; p < 0.001). Participants with values of daily bouts of sustained PA below the median had higher rates of SAEs during follow-up, compared to participants above the median (41% vs 24%; p = 0.002). In conclusion, among participants with PAD, lower ABI values were associated with fewer bouts of daily sustained PA. A greater number of bouts of daily sustained PA were associated with better 6MW performance and SF-36 PF score, and, in longitudinal analyses, lower rates of SAEs.

While it is undoubtedly important to test drugs in these animal models, additional evidence for drug efficacy in a human context might improve our chances of success. Accordingly, in order to test drugs in a human context, we have developed a platform of physiological assays using patch-clamp electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and multielectrode array (MEA) experiments on human (h)iPSC-derived 2D cortical neuronal cultures and 3D cerebral organoids. We compare hiPSCs bearing familial AD mutations vs. their wild-type (WT) isogenic controls in order to characterize the aberrant electrical activity in such a human context. Here, we show that these AD neuronal cultures and organoids manifest increased spontaneous action potentials, slow oscillatory events (~1 Hz), and hypersynchronous network activity. Importantly, the dual-allosteric NMDAR antagonist NitroSynapsin, but not the FDA-approved drug memantine, abrogated this hyperactivity.

Recent studies have uncovered the involvement of the CP in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis. However, our understanding of human age-related microstructural and functional changes in the CP with aging and neuropathology is limited. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated age and sex differences in the CP structure and function using advanced quantitative magnetic resonance imaging methodology in a large cohort (n = 155) of cognitively unimpaired individuals over a wide age range between 21 and 94 years. Our analysis included volumetric measurements, relaxometry measures (T1 and T2), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), as well as measures of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Our results revealed that CP volume was increasing with advancing age. We conjecture that this novel observation is likely attributed to alterations in the CP microstructure or function as well as to ventriculomegaly. Indeed, we also found that CBF was lower with advanced age, while, consistent with previous studies, T1, T2 and MD were higher, and FA was lower with advanced age. We attribute these functional and microstructural differences to a deteriorated CP structural integrity with aging. Furthermore, our relaxometry and DTI measures were found to be associated with differences in blood perfusion revealing lower microstructural integrity with lower CBF.

We tested the performance of NESMA and its effect on the accuracy of the injury biomarker maps, relative to the co-registered histological reference.

In other terms, these cues are both causes and effects of clock molecular activation (recursion). Recently, we demonstrated that Ca2+ and Vm transitions during AP cycles in single SAN cells isolated from mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, and humans are self-similar (obey a power law) and are also self-similar to trans-species AP firing intervals (APFIs) of these cells in vitro, to heart rate in vivo, and to body mass. Neurotransmitter stimulation of β-adrenergic receptor or cholinergic receptor–initiated signaling in SAN cells modulates their AP firing rate and rhythm by impacting on the degree to which SAN clocks couple to each other, creating the broad physiologic range of SAN cell mean APFIs and firing interval variabilities. Here we show that Ca2+ and Vm domain kinetic transitions (time to AP ignition in diastole and 90% AP recovery) occurring within given AP, the mean APFIs, and APFI variabilities within the time series of APs in 230 individual SAN cells are self-similar (obey power laws). In other terms, these long-range correlations inform on self-similar distributions of order among SAN cells across the entire broad physiologic range of SAN APFIs, regardless of whether autonomic receptors of these cells are stimulated or not and regardless of the type (adrenergic or cholinergic) of autonomic receptor stimulation. These long-range correlations among distributions of Ca2+ and Vm kinetic functions that regulate SAN cell clock coupling during each AP cycle in different individual, isolated SAN cells not in contact with each other. Our numerical model simulations further extended our perspectives to the molecular scale and demonstrated that many ion currents also behave self-similar across autonomic states. Thus, to ensure rapid flexibility of AP firing rates in response to different types and degrees of autonomic input, nature “did not reinvent molecular wheels within the coupled-clock system of pacemaker cells,” but differentially engaged or scaled the kinetics of gears that regulate the rate and rhythm at which the “wheels spin” in a given autonomic input context.",11,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,10,10,21100215107,NIH,330/19,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,151,action potential | autonomic receptor stimulation | diastolic depolarization | firing interval variability | local diastolic Ca  releases 2+ | self-similarity of Ca  and membrane potential during action potentials 2+ | single sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells,612770,NA

However, the extent to which white matter abnormalities relate to amyloid deposition, a marker of Alzheimer pathology, remains unclear. This cross-sectional study examined the association of white matter abnormalities with cortical amyloid in a community sample of older adults without dementia and examined the moderating effect of race. METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants from the ARIC-PET (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities-Positron Emission Tomography) study underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, which quantified white matter hyperintensity volume and microstructural integrity using diffusion tensor imaging. Participants received florbetapir positron emission tomography imaging to measure brain amyloid. Associations between measures of white matter structure and elevated amyloid status were examined using multivariable logistic regression.

Although genomic instability is associated with aging and mitochondrial impairment, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that base excision repair generates genomic stress, promoting age-related neurodegeneration in a Caenorhabditis elegans PD model. A physiological level of NTH-1 DNA glycosylase mediates mitochondrial and nuclear genomic instability, which promote degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in older nematodes. Conversely, NTH-1 deficiency protects against α-synuclein-induced neurotoxicity, maintaining neuronal function with age.

Therefore, understanding the molecular and cellular defects that destabilize chromosomal integrity is paramount to cancer diagnosis, treatment and cure. DNA repair and the replication stress response are overarching paradigms for maintenance of genomic stability, but the devil is in the details. ATP-dependent helicases serve to unwind DNA so it is replicated, transcribed, recombined and repaired efficiently through coordination with other nucleic acid binding and metabolizing proteins. Alternatively folded DNA structures deviating from the conventional anti-parallel double helix pose serious challenges to normal genomic transactions. Accumulating evidence suggests that G-quadruplex (G4) DNA is problematic for replication. Although there are multiple human DNA helicases that can resolve G4 in vitro, it is debated which helicases are truly important to resolve such structures in vivo. Recent advances have begun to elucidate the principal helicase actors, particularly in cellular DNA replication. FANCJ, a DNA helicase implicated in cancer and the chromosomal instability disorder Fanconi Anemia, takes center stage in G4 resolution to allow smooth DNA replication.

Whether ambient air pollution contributes to the heterogeneity of episodic memory decline in older populations remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: We estimated associations between air pollution exposures and episodic memory decline according to pollutant, exposure time window, age, and latent class subgroups defined by episodic memory trajectories. METHODS: Participants were from the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study–Epidemiology of Cognitive Health Outcomes. Older women (n = 2,056; 74–92 years of age) completed annual (2008–2018) episodic memory assessments using the telephone-based California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). We estimated 3-y average fine particulate matter [PM with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤2:5 lm (PM2:5)] and nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ) exposures at baseline and 10 y earlier (recent and remote exposures, respectively), using regionalized national universal kriging. Separate latent class mixed models were used to esti-mate associations between interquartile range increases in exposures and CVLT trajectories in women ≤80 and >80 years of age, adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Two latent classes were identified for women ≤80 years of age (n = 828), “slow-decliners” {slope = − 0:12=y [95% confidence interval (CI): −0:23, −0:01] and “fast-decliners” [slope = − 1:79=y (95% CI: −2:08, −1:50)]}. In the slow-decliner class, but not the fast-decliner class, PM2:5 exposures were associated with a greater decline in CVLT scores over time, with a stronger association for recent vs. remote exposures [−0:16=y (95% CI: −2:08, −0:03) per 2:88 lg=m3 and −0:11=y (95% CI: −0:22, 0.01) per 3:27 lg=m3, respectively]. Among women ≥80 years of age (n = 1,128), the largest latent class comprised “steady-decliners” [slope = − 1:35=y (95% CI: −1:53, −1:17)], whereas the second class, “cognitively resilient”, had no decline in CVLT on average. PM2:5 was not associated with episodic memory decline in either class. A 6:25-ppb increase in recent NO2 was associated with nonsignificant acceleration of episodic memory decline in the ≤80-y-old fast-decliner class [−0:21=y (95% CI: −0:45, 0.04)], and in the >80-y-old cognitively resilient class [−0:10=y (95% CI: −0:24, 0.03)] and steady-decliner class [−0:11=y (95% CI: −0:27, 0.05)]. Associations with recent NO2 exposure in women >80 years of age were stronger and statistically significant when 267 women with incident probable dementia were excluded [e.g., −0:12=y (95% CI: −0:22, −0:02) for the cognitively resilient class]. In contrast with changes in CVLT over time, there were no associations between exposures and CVLT scores during follow-up in any subgroup.

Here, we explore whether RA signaling is altered in an animal model of neurocognitive aging. We used a Morris water maze protocol to study cognitive decline in aged rats, which assesses hippocampus-dependent spatial memory and reveals substan-tial interindividual differences in aged animals. Aged unimpaired (AU) rats perform on par with young (Y), while aged impaired (AI) animals exhibit spatial memory deficits. We show that the major substrate for RA, retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), is decreased in AU rats, and retinol cell surface receptor declines with chronological age. Other affected components of RA signaling include selective increases in AI animals in hippocampal synthesis (RALDH1) and catabolism of RA (CYP26B1), RA receptor a, the RA regulated ionotropic glutamate receptor (GluR1), as well as fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP).

Using gene knockdown and overexpression approaches, Western blotting, and promoter pull-down assay, we show that collagen type I-activated Discoidin Domain Receptor 2 (DDR2) mediates Angiotensin II-dependent transcriptional upregulation of fibronectin by Yes-activated Protein in cardiac fibroblasts. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated fibronectin knockdown attenuated Angiotensin II-stimulated expression of collagen type I and anti-apoptotic cIAP2, and enhanced cardiac fibroblast susceptibility to apoptosis. Importantly, an obligate role for fibronectin was observed in Angiotensin II-stimulated expression of AT1R, the Angiotensin II receptor, which would link extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling and Angiotensin II signaling in cardiac fibroblasts. The role of fibronectin in Angiotensin II-stimulated cIAP2, collagen type I, and AT1R expression was mediated by Integrin-β1-integrin-linked kinase signaling. In vivo, we observed modestly reduced basal levels of AT1R in DDR2-null mouse myocardium, which were associated with the previously reported reduction in myocardial Integrin-β1 levels. The role of fibronectin, downstream of DDR2, could be a critical determinant of cardiac fibroblast-mediated wound healing following myocardial injury.

To address this question, mice were fed a low or high LA diet low in OXLAMs, or a low LA diet supplemented with OXLAMs from heated corn oil (high OXLAM diet). Unesterified oxidized fatty acids (i.e. oxylipins), including OXLAMs, were measured in liver after 8 weeks of dietary intervention using ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass-spectrometry.

Our purpose is to propose a partial volume correction (PVC) method to tackle this issue. Methods: In the present work, we explore a voxel-based PVC method under the least squares framework (LS) employing anatomical non-local means (NLMA) regularization. The well-known non-local means (NLM) filter utilizes the high degree of information redundancy that typically exists in images, and is typically used to directly reduce image noise by replacing each voxel intensity with a weighted average of its non-local neighbors. Here we explore NLM as a regularization term within iterative-deconvolution model to perform PVC. Further, an anatomical-guided version of NLM was proposed that incorporates MRI information into NLM to improve resolution and suppress image noise. The proposed approach makes subtle usage of the accompanying MRI information to define a more appropriate search space within the prior model. To optimize the regularized LS objective function, we used the Gauss-Seidel (GS) algorithm with the one-step-late (OSL) technique. Results: After the import of NLMA, the visual and quality results are all improved. With a visual check, we notice that NLMA reduce the noise compared to other PVC methods. This is also validated in bias-noise curve compared to non-MRI-guided PVC framework. We can see NLMA gives better bias-noise trade-off compared to other PVC methods. Conclusions: Our efforts were evaluated in the base of amyloid brain PET imaging using the BrainWeb phantom and in vivo human data. We also compared our method with other PVC methods. Overall, we demonstrated the value of introducing subtle MRI-guidance in the regularization process, the proposed NLMA method resulting in promising visual as well as quantitative performance improvements.",7,34365117,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,17037,NIH,AG056142,National Institutes of Health,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,164,Anatomical guidance | NLMA | Non-Local Means | Partial Volume Correction | PET,NA,S1120179721002726

Until recently geroscience research was pursued in laboratory animals, but now this field requires specialized expertise in the care of vulnerable older patients with multiple chronic diseases and geriatric syndromes, the population likely to benefit the most from emerging therapies. While chronological aging measures the inevitable passage of clock time that occurs equally for everyone, biological aging varies among individuals, and importantly, it is modifiable. Advances in our understanding of biological aging, the discovery of strategies for modifying its rate, and an appreciation of aging as a shared risk factor for chronic diseases have jointly led to the Geroscience Hypothesis. This hypothesis states that interventions modifying aging biology can slow its progression—resulting in the delay or prevention of the onset of multiple diseases and disorders. Here we wish to report on the Third Geroscience Summit held at National Institutes of Health on November 4–5, 2019, which highlighted the importance of engaging other disciplines including clinicians. Involvement by scientists with expertise in clinical trials, health outcomes research, behavioral and social sciences, health policy, and economics is urgently needed to translate geroscience discoveries from the bench to clinical care and health policy.

Of particular concern is the neurotoxicity previously observed in rat models following acute exposure to high doses of ketamine, broadly referred to as ‘Olney's lesions’. This type of toxicity presents as abnormal neuronal cellular vacuolization, followed by neuronal death and has been associated with ketamine's inhibition of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). In this study, a pharmacological and neuropathological analysis of ketamine, the potent NMDAR antagonist MK-801, and the ketamine metabolite (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine [(2R,6R)-HNK)] in rats is described following both single dose and repeat dose drug exposures.

Main outcome measures Cognitive stimulation was measured at baseline using standard questionnaire instruments on active versus passive jobs and at baseline and over time using a job exposure matrix indicator. 4953 proteins in plasma samples were scanned. Follow-up of incident dementia varied between 13.7 to 30.1 years depending on the cohort. People with dementia were identified through linked electronic health records and repeated clinical examinations.

The result is a more severe morbidity following infections, more prolonged and frequent hospitalization, and a higher mortality rate than in the general population. Therefore, there is an increasing need to develop vaccination strategies that overcome immunosenescence, especially for aging-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we report a new vaccination strategy harnessing memory-based immunity, which is less affected by aging. We found that aged C57BL/6 and 5xFAD mice exhibit a dramatic reduction in anti-Amyloid-β (Aβ) antibody (Ab) production. We aimed to reverse this process by inducing memory response at a young age. To this end, young mice were primed with the vaccine carrier Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). At an advanced age, these mice were immunized with an Aβ1-11 fused to HBsAg. This vaccination scheme elicited a markedly higher Aβ-specific antibody titer than vaccinating aged unprimed mice with the same construct. Importantly, this vaccine strategy more efficiently reduced cerebral Aβ levels and altered microglial phenotype. Overall, we provide evidence that priming with an exogenous Ag carrier can overcome impaired humoral responses to self-antigens in the elderly, paving the route for a potent immunotherapy to AD.",8,34294479,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,21376,NIH,ZIAAG000770,National Institutes of Health,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,182,Alzheimer's disease | Amyloid-β | Immunosenescence | Microglia | Priming | Vaccine,NA,S0264410X21008823

Consequently, the mechanisms of initiating and regulating the normal spontaneous SA node beating rate are of vital importance. Spontaneous firing of the SA node is generated within sinoatrial nodal cells (SANC), which is regulated by the coupled‐clock pacemaker system. Normal spontaneous beating of SANC is driven by a high level of cAMP‐mediated PKA‐dependent protein phosphorylation, which rely on the balance between high basal cAMP production by adenylyl cyclases and high basal cAMP degradation by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). This diverse class of enzymes includes 11 families and PDE3 and PDE4 families dominate in both the SA node and cardiac myocardium, degrading cAMP and, consequently, regulating basal cardiac pacemaker function and excitation-contraction coupling. In this review, we will demonstrate similarities between expression, distribution, and colocalization of various PDE subtypes in SANC and cardiac myocytes of different species, including humans, focusing on PDE3 and PDE4. Here, we will describe specific targets of the coupled‐clock pacemaker system modulated by dual PDE3 + PDE4 activation and provide evidence that concurrent activation of PDE3 + PDE4, operating in a synergistic manner, regulates the basal cardiac pacemaker function and provides control over normal spontaneous beating of SANCs through (PDE3 + PDE4)‐dependent modulation of local subsarcolemmal Ca2+ releases (LCRs).",14,34445119,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,25879,NIH,undefined,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,184,Adenylyl cyclase | Cardiac pacemaker cells | Local Ca  release 2+ | Phosphodiesterase | Phospholamban | Sarcoplasmic reticulum | Sinoatrial node,8414,NA

The sympathetic nervous system increases the heart rate commensurate with the cardiac output demand via stimulation of SAN β‐adrenergic receptors (βAR). While SAN cells reportedly represent a highly heterogeneous cell population, the current dogma is that, in response to βAR stimulation, all cells increase their spontaneous AP firing rate in a similar fashion. The aim of the present study was to investigate the cell‐to‐cell variability in the responses of a large population of SAN cells. We measured the βAR responses among 166 single SAN cells isolated from 33 guinea pig hearts. In contrast to the current dogma, the SAN cell responses to βAR stimulation substantially varied. In each cell, changes in the AP cycle length were highly correlated (R2 = 0.97) with the AP cycle length before βAR stimulation. While, as expected, on average, the cells increased their pacemaker rate, greater responses were observed in cells with slower basal rates, and vice versa: cells with higher basal rates showed smaller responses, no responses, or even decreased their rate.

However, even if a network is trained on a large dataset from the source domain, its performance on unseen test domains is not guaranteed. The performance drop on data obtained differently from the network's training data is a major problem (known as domain shift) in deploying deep learning in clinical practice. Existing work focuses on retraining the model with data from the test domain, or harmonizing the test domain's data to the network training data. A common practice is to distribute a carefully-trained model to multiple users (e.g., clinical centers), and then each user uses the model to process their own data, which may have a domain shift (e.g., varying imaging parameters and machines). However, the lack of availability of the source training data and the cost of training a new model often prevents the use of known methods to solve user-specific domain shifts. Here, we ask whether we can design a model that, once distributed to users, can quickly adapt itself to each new site without expensive retraining or access to the source training data? In this paper, we propose a model that can adapt based on a single test subject during inference. The model consists of three parts, which are all neural networks: a task model (T) which performs the image analysis task like segmentation; a set of autoencoders (AEs); and a set of adaptors (As). The task model and autoencoders are trained on the source dataset and can be computationally expensive. In the deployment stage, the adaptors are trained to transform the test image and its features to minimize the domain shift as measured by the autoencoders’ reconstruction loss. Only the adaptors are optimized during the testing stage with a single test subject thus is computationally efficient. The method was validated on both retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) image segmentation and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T1-weighted to T2-weighted image synthesis. Our method, with its short optimization time for the adaptors (10 iterations on a single test subject) and its additional required disk space for the autoencoders (around 15 MB), can achieve significant performance improvement.

In this scoping review we aimed to systematically collect the evidence on 1) the impact of common infections such as influenza, pneumonia and varicella zoster on frailty development, and 2) the role played by frailty in the response to immunization of older adults. Findings are discussed under a unifying framework to identify knowledge gaps and outline their clinical and public health implications to foster a healthier aging. Twenty-nine studies (113,863 participants) selected to answer the first question provided a moderately strong evidence of an association between infections and physical as well as cognitive decline – two essential dimensions of frailty. Thirteen studies (34,520 participants) investigating the second aim, showed that frailty was associated with an impaired immune response in older ages, likely due to immunosenescence. However, the paucity of studies, the absence of tools to predict vaccine efficacy, and the lack of studies investigating the efficacy of newer vaccines in presence of frailty, strongly limit the formulation of more personalized immunization strategies for older adults. The current evidence suggests that infections and frailty repeatedly cross each other pathophysiological paths and accelerate the aging process in a vicious circle. Such evidence opens to several considerations. First, the prevention of both conditions pass through a life course approach, which includes several individual and societal aspects. Second, the maintenance of a well-functioning immune system may be accomplished by preventing frailty, and vice versa. Third, increasing the adherence to immunization may delay the onset of frailty and maintain the immune system homeostasis, beyond preventing infections.",58,33971332,Journal,re,Review,100,9,9,28475,NIA,ZIAAG000971,National Institute on Aging,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,197,Frailty | Healthy aging | Immunosenescence | Vaccination,101351,S1568163721000982

Plasminogen activator-inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and the plasma product D-dimer are important components of the fibrinolytic system. There have been few large-scale genome-wide or exome-wide studies of PAI-1, tPA, and D-dimer.

Methods: Cohort-level analyses and fixed effects meta-analyses of PAI-1 (n = 15 603), tPA (n = 6876,) and D-dimer (n = 19 306) from 12 cohorts of European ancestry with diverse study design were conducted, including single-variant analyses and gene-based burden testing.

Analyses indicated that, relative to a probabilistic atlas, utilizing nmT1 images to individually localize the LC increases the specificity of seed time series and clusters in the iFC maps.

The effects of acquiring nmT1 images and ME-fMRI data did not appear to only reflect increases in power: iFC maps for each approach overlapped only moderately. This is consistent with findings that ME-fMRI offers substantial advantages over 1E-fMRI acquisition and denoising.

Methods: The version 1 release contains whole-genome sequencing data derived from 3941 participants from 4 cohorts. Samples underwent joint genotyping by the TOPMed Freeze 9 Variant Calling Pipeline. We performed descriptive analyses of these whole-genome sequencing data using the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Parkinson's Disease platform. Results: The clinical diagnosis of participants in version 1 release includes 2005 idiopathic PD patients, 963 healthy controls, 64 prodromal subjects, 62 clinically diagnosed PD subjects without evidence of dopamine deficit, and 705 participants of genetically enriched cohorts carrying PD risk-associated GBA variants or LRRK2 variants, of whom 304 were affected.

Theory and methods: Fick’s first law was extended for describing tissue perfusion as anomalous superdiffusion, which is non-Gaussian diffusion exhibiting greater particle spread than that of the Gaussian case. This was accomplished using a space-fractional derivative that gives rise to a power-law relationship between mean squared displacement and time, and produces a stretched exponential signal decay as a function of b-value. Numerical simulations were used to estimate parameter errors under in vivo conditions, and examine the effect of limited SNR and residual fat signal. Stretched exponential DWI parameters, α and (Formula presented.), were measured in thigh muscles of 4 healthy volunteers at rest and following in-magnet exercise. These parameters were related to a stable distribution of jump-length probabilities and used to estimate microvascular volume fractions. Results: Numerical simulations showed low dispersion in parameter estimates within 1.5% and 1%, and bias errors within 3% and 10%, for α and (Formula presented.), respectively. Superdiffusion was observed in resting muscle, and to a greater degree following exercise. Resting microvascular volume fraction was between 0.0067 and 0.0139 and increased between 2.2-fold and 4.7-fold following exercise. Conclusions: This model captures superdiffusive molecular motions consistent with perfusion, using a parsimonious representation of the DWI signal, providing approximations of microvascular volume fraction comparable with histological estimates.

Objective: To examine the association between vision and cognitive across multiple cognitive domains using multiple measures of vision. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal cohort study used data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging for 2003 to 2019. Participants in the current study were aged 60 to 94 years with vision and cognitive measures. Data analysis was performed from May 2020 to May 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cognitive function was measured across multiple domains, including language, memory, attention, executive function, and visuospatial ability. Cognitive domain scores were calculated as the mean of standardized cognitive test scores within each domain. Visual function was assessed using measures of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and stereo acuity at baseline. Results: Analyses included 1202 participants (610 women [50.8%]; 853 White participants [71.0%]) with a mean (SD) age of 71.1 (8.6) years who were followed up for a mean (SD) of 6.9 (4.7) years. Worse visual acuity (per 0.1 logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution) at baseline was associated with greater declines in language (β, -0.0035; 95% CI, -0.007 to -0.001) and memory (β, -0.0052; 95% CI, -0.010 to -0.001) domain scores. Worse contrast sensitivity (per 0.1 log units) at baseline was associated with greater declines in language (β, -0.010; 95% CI, -0.014 to -0.006), memory (β, -0.009; 95% CI, -0.015 to -0.003), attention (β, -0.010; 95% CI, -0.017 to -0.003), and visuospatial ability (β, -0.010; 95% CI, -0.017 to -0.002) domain scores. Over the follow-up period, declines on tests of language (β, -0.019; 95% CI, -0.034 to -0.005) and memory (β, -0.032; 95% CI, -0.051 to -0.012) were significantly greater for participants with impaired stereo acuity compared with those without such impairment.

However, in the very old, the dose-response relationship between PA and all-cause mortality and the possible biological mediators of this association are less known. We investigated whether PA predicts 6-year all-cause mortality and what biomarkers mediate the association. Design: Prospective cohort data from the Tokyo Oldest Old Survey on Total Health study. Setting: Community-dwelling population. Participants: A total of 441 women and men aged over 85 years. Measurements: Questionnaire-based PA was assessed at baseline and 3-year and 6-year follow-up visits. Survival status was confirmed up to the 6-year follow-up visit (153 deaths, 34.7%). Data of plasma albumin, cholinesterase, NT-proBNP, interleukin-6, cystatin C, and HbA1c levels were collected. For mediation analysis for survival analysis, we used the baseline PA and biomarkers with Weibull distribution accelerated failure time model and linear regression model adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, education level, and Mini-Mental State Examination. Results: A curvilinear relationship was observed in the association between baseline PA and all-cause mortality. Compared to the inactive (0 METs*h/week), light amount of PA was associated with a lower risk of mortality. Compared to the highest tertile of PA (11.2 METs*h/week), higher PA did not reduce the risk of death. Circulation levels of albumin and cholinesterase mediated the association between baseline PA and all-cause mortality (proportion mediated, 54%, both; p < 0.05). Conclusions: Compared to completely inactive, light PA reduces the risk of all-cause mortality in the very old population.

Conversely, ApoE-/- mice showed low levels of MDA-oxLDL specificity, but had antibodies specific to numerous self-proteins. We provide evidence for a hierarchical order of antibody specificity, where elevated levels of MDA-oxLDL specific IgM antibodies inhibit plaque formation.

Within islet of Langerhans there is an autonomous EC system (ECS). Beta (β)-cells contain all the enzymes necessary for EC synthesis and degradation; ECs are generated in response to cellular depolarization; their paracrine influence on β-cells is mostly through the cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) that is present on all β-cells; they modulate basal and glucose- and incretin-induced insulin secretion, and β-cell responses to various stressors. Furthermore, there is now accumulating evidence from preclinical studies that the autonomous islet ECS is a key player in obesity-induced inflammation in islets, and β-cell damage and apoptosis from many causes can be mitigated by CB1R blockers. We will thoroughly review the literature relevant to the effects of ECs and their receptors on β-cells and the other cell types within islets. Therapeutic potential of agents targeting EC/CB1R and CB2R is highly relevant because the receptors belong to the druggable G protein-coupled receptor superfamily.

To begin to address this question, we examined effects of atorvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, and Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), administration on memory function, anxiety-like behavior, adult hippocampal neurogenesis and angiogenesis in adult and middle-aged male C57Bl/6J mice.

In addition, dentate gyrus (DG) neurogenesis and vascularization were unaffected. In middle-aged mice (10-months-old) combo treatment had no effect on spatial memory in the Morris water maze, but did reduce anxiety in the open field test. A potential underlying mechanism may be the modest increase in new hippocampal neurons (~20%) in the combo as compared to the control group. DG vascularization was not altered.

Every physiological function is being continuously diminished. There is a range between two distinct phenotypes of ageing, shaped by patterns of living - experiences and behaviours, and in particular by the presence or absence of physical activity (PA) and structured exercise (i.e., a sedentary lifestyle). Ageing and a sedentary lifestyle are associated with declines in muscle function and cardiorespiratory fitness, resulting in an impaired capacity to perform daily activities and maintain independent functioning. However, in the presence of adequate exercise/PA these changes in muscular and aerobic capacity with age are substantially attenuated. Additionally, both structured exercise and overall PA play important roles as preventive strategies for many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, osteoporosis, and obesity; improvement of mobility, mental health, and quality of life; and reduction in mortality, among other benefits. Notably, exercise intervention programmes improve the hallmarks of frailty (low body mass, strength, mobility, PA level, energy) and cognition, thus optimising functional capacity during ageing. In these pathological conditions exercise is used as a therapeutic agent and follows the precepts of identifying the cause of a disease and then using an agent in an evidence-based dose to eliminate or moderate the disease. Prescription of PA/structured exercise should therefore be based on the intended outcome (e.g., primary prevention, improvement in fitness or functional status or disease treatment), and individualised, adjusted and controlled like any other medical treatment. In addition, in line with other therapeutic agents, exercise shows a dose-response effect and can be individualised using different modalities, volumes and/or intensities as appropriate to the health state or medical condition. Importantly, exercise therapy is often directed at several physiological systems simultaneously, rather than targeted to a single outcome as is generally the case with pharmacological approaches to disease management. There are diseases for which exercise is an alternative to pharmacological treatment (such as depression), thus contributing to the goal of deprescribing of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMS). There are other conditions where no effective drug therapy is currently available (such as sarcopenia or dementia), where it may serve a primary role in prevention and treatment. Therefore, this consensus statement provides an evidence-based rationale for using exercise and PA for health promotion and disease prevention and treatment in older adults. Exercise prescription is discussed in terms of the specific modalities and doses that have been studied in randomised controlled trials for their effectiveness in attenuating physiological changes of ageing, disease prevention, and/or improvement of older adults with chronic disease and disability. Recommendations are proposed to bridge gaps in the current literature and to optimise the use of exercise/PA both as a preventative medicine and as a therapeutic agent.",657,34409961,Journal,ar,Article,100,36,36,26661,NIH,undefined,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,216,diseases | exercise | falls | frail | functional capacity | multicomponent training | Sarcopenia,NA,NA

Results: Congestive HF was induced in rabbits by left ventricular volume- and pressure-overload producing left ventricular hypertrophy, diminished fractional shortening and ejection fraction, and increased left ventricular dimensions. HF baseline QRS and corrected QT interval were prolonged by 17% and 21% (mean±SEMs: 303±6 ms HF, 249±11 ms control; n=8/7; P=0.0002), suggesting PF dysfunction and impaired ventricular repolarization.

Methods: We performed the first genomewide association study of penetrance and age-at-onset of Parkinson's disease in LRRK2 mutation carriers (776 cases and 1,103 non-cases at their last evaluation). Cox proportional hazard models and linear mixed models were used to identify modifiers of penetrance and age-at-onset of LRRK2 mutations, respectively. We also investigated whether a polygenic risk score derived from a published genomewide association study of Parkinson's disease was able to explain variability in penetrance and age-at-onset in LRRK2 mutation carriers. Results: A variant located in the intronic region of CORO1C on chromosome 12 (rs77395454; p value = 2.5E-08, beta = 1.27, SE = 0.23, risk allele: C) met genomewide significance for the penetrance model. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses of LRRK2 and CORO1C supported an interaction between these 2 proteins. A region on chromosome 3, within a previously reported linkage peak for Parkinson's disease susceptibility, showed suggestive associations in both models (penetrance top variant: p value = 1.1E-07; age-at-onset top variant: p value = 9.3E-07). A polygenic risk score derived from publicly available Parkinson's disease summary statistics was a significant predictor of penetrance, but not of age-at-onset. Interpretation: This study suggests that variants within or near CORO1C may modify the penetrance of LRRK2 mutations. In addition, common Parkinson's disease associated variants collectively increase the penetrance of LRRK2 mutations.

It is hypothesized that SIRT1 and SIRT3 are critical components to maintaining mitochondria homeostasis especially mitochondrial dynamics to exert cardioprotective actions under I/R stress. The results demonstrated that deficiency of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in aged (24–26 months) mice hearts led to the exacerbated cardiac dysfunction in terms of cardiac systolic dysfunction, cardiomyocytes contractile defection, and abnormal cardiomyocyte calcium flux during I/R stress. Moreover, the deletion of SIRT1 or SIRT3 in young (4–6 months) mice hearts impair cardiomyocyte contractility and shows aging-like cardiac dysfunction upon I/R stress, indicating the crucial role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in protecting myocardial contractility from I/R injury. The biochemical and seahorse analysis showed that the deficiency of SIRT1/SIRT3 leads to the inactivation of AMPK and alterations in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) that causes impaired mitochondrial respiration in response to I/R stress. Furthermore, the remodeling of the mitochondria network goes together with hypoxic stress, and mitochondria undergo the processes of fusion with the increasing elongated branches during hypoxia.

Methods: To investigate the mechanism of action of PLAC1 we did cell fractionation and immunoprecipitation of the protein and Mass Spectrometry analysis to identify its interaction partners. The associated proteins were directly tested for interactions by co-transfection with PLAC1 and immunoprecipitation. Mutations in the ZP-N domain of PLAC1 were introduced to assess its involvement in the interactions. Results: We provide evidence that Desmoglein-2 (DSG2), a component of the membrane-associated desmosomal complex, directly interacts with PLAC1. Mutations of cysteines in ZP-N domain disrupt the interaction between PLAC1 and DSG-2. Discussion: Because desmosomes are responsible for establishing lateral cell-cell junctions, we suggest that direct interaction with the lateral junction protein complex may be implicated in the PLAC1 effects on cell-cell interactions, and thereby on the layer structure of the placenta.",5,34118612,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,17069,NIA,ZIAAG000646,National Institute on Aging,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,222,Cancer | Desmoglein-2 | Placenta | ZP-N domain,NA,S0143400421001661

Higher levels of circulating coagulants have been associated with higher risk of cerebral infarctions and dementia. In contrast, higher levels of circulating protein C, an endogenous anticoagulant, have been associated with lower risk of cerebral infarctions, and the association between protein C levels and the risk of dementia is unknown. The goal of this study was to evaluate the association of circulating protein C levels in midlife and late life with incident dementia. Methods: Circulating protein C levels were measured using blood samples collected at the midlife baseline (1987-1989) and the late-life baseline (2011-2013) among 14,462 and 3,614 participants, respectively, in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. Protein C levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at midlife and a modified aptamer-based assay at late life. Participants were followed up to 2013 from midlife and up to 2017 from late life. Incident dementia was ascertained during the follow-up periods using in-person cognitive and functional assessment, informant interviews, and International Classification of Diseases codes at hospitalization discharge and on death certificates. Cause-specific Cox regression models were used to evaluate the association between quintiles of circulating protein C and incident dementia. Results: From midlife (mean age of 54), 1,389 incident dementia events were observed over a median follow-up of 23 years. From late life (mean age of 75), 353 incident dementia events were observed over a median follow-up of 4.9 years. At both midlife and late life, circulating protein C had an inverse association with incident dementia after adjusting for demographic, vascular, and hemostatic risk factors, incident stroke as time-dependent covariate, and incorporating stabilized weights based on propensity scores (quintile 5 vs. quintile 1 as the reference, midlife hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.66-0.96, p value for trend 0.04; late-life hazard ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval: 0.55-1.28, p value for trend 0.04).

Men are on average ~ 1.5 times more likely to develop PD compared to women with European ancestry. Over the years, genomewide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic risk factors for PD, however, it is unclear whether genetics contribute to disease etiology in a sex-specific manner. Methods: In an effort to study sex-specific genetic factors associated with PD, we explored 2 large genetic datasets from the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium and the UK Biobank consisting of 13,020 male PD cases, 7,936 paternal proxy cases, 89,660 male controls, 7,947 female PD cases, 5,473 maternal proxy cases, and 90,662 female controls. We performed GWAS meta-analyses to identify distinct patterns of genetic risk contributing to disease in male versus female PD cases. Results: In total, 19 genomewide significant regions were identified and no sex-specific effects were observed. A high genetic correlation between the male and female PD GWAS were identified (rg = 0.877) and heritability estimates were identical between male and female PD cases (~ 20%). Interpretation: We did not detect any significant genetic differences between male or female PD cases. Our study does not support the notion that common genetic variation on the autosomes could explain the difference in prevalence of PD between males and females cases at least when considering the current sample size under study. Further studies are warranted to investigate the genetic architecture of PD explained by X and Y chromosomes and further evaluate environmental effects that could potentially contribute to PD etiology in male versus female patients.

Data were derived from a 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial secondarily evaluating the efficacy of infliximab on a measure of anhedonia (i.e., Snaith–Hamilton Pleasure Scale). Three inflammatory biotypes were derived from peripheral cytokine measurements using an iterative, machine learning-based approach. Infliximab-randomized participants classified as biotype 3 exhibited lower baseline concentrations of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and soluble TNF receptor-1 and reported greater pro-hedonic improvements, relative to those classified as biotype 1 or 2. Pretreatment biotypes also moderated changes in neuroinflammatory substrates relevant to infliximab’s hypothesized mechanism of action. Neuronal origin-enriched extracellular vesicle (NEV) protein concentrations were reduced to two factors using principal axis factoring: phosphorylated nuclear factorκB (p-NFκB), Fas-associated death domain (p-FADD), and IκB kinase (p-IKKα/β) and TNF receptor-1 (TNFR1) comprised factor “NEV1,” whereas phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (p-IRS1), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-p38), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK) constituted “NEV2”. Among infliximab-randomized subjects classified as biotype 3, NEV1 scores were decreased at weeks 2 and 6 and increased at week 12, relative to baseline, and NEV2 scores increased over time. Decreases in NEV1 scores and increases in NEV2 scores were associated with greater reductions in anhedonic symptoms in our classification and regression tree model (r2 = 0.22, RMSE = 0.08).

However, little is known about when it starts, how PD changes as it progresses, and whether there is a differential loss of lean or fat mass. The objective of this study was to examine how body composition changes before and after PD diagnosis. Methods: In the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study (n = 3075; age range, 70–79 years), body composition was assessed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry on an annual or biennial basis from year 1 to year 10. For each PD case each year, we calculated the difference between their actual body composition measures and expected values had they not developed PD. Using linear mixed models with crossed random effects, we further examined the trend of change in body composition measures before and after PD diagnosis. Results: A total of 80 PD cases were identified in this cohort. Compared with their expected values, PD cases began to lose total and fat mass about 6–7 years before diagnosis, although the differences were not statistically significant until 3–5 years after diagnosis. The loss was substantial and persistent, with statistically significant trends of loss for total body mass (P = 0.008), fat mass (P = 0.001), and percentage fat (P < 0.001). In comparison, lean mass was stable throughout the follow-up (P = 0.16). Overall, 96% of the body mass loss in PD cases was from the loss of fat mass.

Objective: To assess whether hearing impairment is associated with poorer physical function, reduced walking endurance, and faster decline in physical function. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were performed using data from the 2011 to 2019 period of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, a population-based study of community-dwelling adults at 4 sites in the US. Exposures: Hearing thresholds (per 10 dB) assessed with pure tone audiometry and categorized as normal hearing or mild, moderate, or severe hearing impairment. Main Outcomes and Measures: Physical function was assessed using the short physical performance battery (SPPB), with composite scores ranging from 0 to 12. A composite score of 6 or less and a score for each component (balance, gait speed, and chair stands) of 2 or less indicated poor performance. Walking endurance was assessed using a 2-minute fast-paced walk test. Tobit regression models adjusted for sociodemographic factors and medical history were used to calculate the mean differences in SPPB composite scores; logistic regression models, to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of low SPPB composite and component scores; and linear mixed-effects models, to estimate the mean rate of change in SPPB composite scores over time. Results: Of the 2956 participants (mean [SD] age, 79 [4.6] years) who attended study visit 6 between 2016 and 2017, 1722 (58.3%) were women, and 2356 (79.7%) were White.

In the Tobit regression model, severe hearing impairment was associated with a lower mean SPPB score (β, -0.82; 95% CI, -0.34 to -1.30) compared with normal hearing. In fully adjusted logistic regression models, hearing impairment was associated with higher odds of low physical performance scores (severe impairment vs normal hearing: OR for composite physical performance, 2.51 [95% CI, 1.47-4.27]; OR for balance, 2.58 [95% CI, 1.62-4.12]; OR for gait speed, 2.11 [95% CI, 1.03-4.33]).

Using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening approach, we identified LEO1 (Phe381-Ser568 region) as an interacting protein partner of full-length and C-terminal (Pro1010-Cys1493) CSB in two independent screens. LEO1 is a member of the RNA polymerase associated factor 1 complex (PAF1C) with roles in transcription elongation and chromatin modification. Supportive of the Y2H results, purified, recombinant LEO1 and CSB directly interact in vitro, and the two proteins exist in a common complex within human cells. In addition, fluorescently tagged LEO1 and CSB are both recruited to localized DNA damage sites in human cells. Cell fractionation experiments revealed a transcription-dependent, coordinated association of LEO1 and CSB to chromatin following either UVC irradiation or cisplatin treatment of HEK293T cells, whereas the response to menadione was distinct, suggesting that this collaboration occurs mainly in the context of bulky transcription-blocking lesions. Consistent with a coordinated interaction in DNA repair, LEO1 knockdown or knockout resulted in reduced CSB recruitment to chromatin, increased sensitivity to UVC light and cisplatin damage, and reduced RNA synthesis recovery and slower excision of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers following UVC irradiation; the absence of CSB resulted in diminished LEO1 recruitment. Our data indicate a reciprocal communication between CSB and LEO1 in the context of transcription-associated DNA repair and RNA transcription recovery.",9,34096589,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,14204,NIH,ZIAAG000722,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,235,NA,NA,NA

In the present work, conducted on a large cohort of 140 cognitively unimpaired subjects spanning a wide age range of 21 to 94 years, we implemented a multi-parameter approach to characterize the sex-and age differences. In addition, we examined regional correlations between myelin water fraction (MWF), a direct measure of myelin content, and diffusion tensor imaging indices, and transverse and longitudinal relaxation rates to evaluate whether these metrics provide information complementary to MWF. We observed region-dependent differences in myelin content and axonal density with age and found that both exhibit an inverted U-shape association with age in several brainstem substructures. We emphasize that the microstructural differences captured by our distinct MRI metrics, along with their weak associations with MWF, strongly indicate the potential of using these outcome measures in a multi-parametric approach.

Drugs and nutritional supplements developed for a variety of purposes kill senescent cells (senolytics) or suppress their secretions (senomorphics). There is interest in repurposing such drugs to treat or prevent age-related diseases. To date, only small-scale preliminary trials have been conducted. Method: At a workshop convened by the National Institute on Aging in August 2019, academic, industry, and government scientists reviewed issues for phase II trials of potentially repurposable drugs, or dietary supplements, to assess benefits and risks of their senolytic (killing senescent cells) or senomorphic (altering senescent cells' phenotypes) effects in treating or preventing age-related conditions. Results: Participants reviewed mechanisms and effects of cellular senescence, senolytics, and senomorphics of several classes and their potential role in treating or preventing disease, modulators of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, needs for senescence markers, data and specimen resources, infrastructure for planning trials, and potential effects on outcomes in older patients with multimorbidity and polypharmacy. Conclusions: Participants noted the importance of considering potential effects of candidate drugs on multiple aging outcomes. It is important to assess drugs' specificity for killing senescent cells and the balance between senolytic and cytotoxic effects. Markers of specific senescent cell types are needed to assess intervention responses. There are potential interactions with coexisting diseases and their treatments in older persons. Standardized measures could enhance comparisons and pooling of data.

Methods: Caregiving in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study (57.7% women, 62% African American (AA)) was measured at waves 3 (2009–2013) and 4 (2013–2017) (mean follow-up time 4.1 years). Diet quality was assessed by the Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI-2010) derived from two separate 24 h diet recalls. Multivariable ordinary least square regression was performed for cross-sectional analyses of the association of wave 4 caregiving with wave 4 HEI-2010. Wave 3 caregiving was examined both cross-sectionally and with annual rate of change in HEI using mixed-effects linear regression Models.

However, laboratory studies have not yielded a consensus on which specific reward-related processes are influenced by serotonin and in what manner. Here we explored the role of serotonin in cue-reward learning in mice. In a first series of experiments, we found that acute administration of the serotonin reuptake inhibitors citalopram, fluoxetine, or duloxetine all reduced lever pressing reinforced on an FR1 schedule with presentation of a cue that had been previously paired with delivery of food. However, citalopram had no effect on responding that was reinforced with both cue and food on an FR1 schedule. Furthermore, citalopram did not affect nose poke responses that produced no auditory, visual, or proprioceptive cues but were reinforced with food pellets on a progressive ratio schedule. We next performed region-specific knock out of tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (Tph2), the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin synthesis. Viral delivery of Cre recombinase was targeted to dorsal or median raphe nuclei (DRN, MRN), the major sources of ascending serotonergic projections. MRN but not DRN knockouts were impaired in development of cue-elicited approach during Pavlovian conditioning; both groups were subsequently hyper-responsive when lever pressing for cue presentation. The inhibitory effect of citalopram was attenuated in DRN but not MRN knockouts. Our findings are in agreement with prior studies showing serotonin to suppress responding for conditioned reinforcers. Furthermore, these results suggest an inhibitory role of MRN serotonin neurons in the initial attribution of motivational properties to a reward-predictive cue, but not in its subsequent maintenance.

Materials and Methods: We utilized data from 864 men from the AGES-Reykjavik Study with complete pineal gland volumes and urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin measurements. Pineal parenchyma, calcification, and cyst volumes were calculated from brain magnetic resonance imaging. Levels of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin were assayed from prediagnostic urine samples.

Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have explored the relationship between diabetes and the risk of PD, but the results have been conflicting. Objective: The objective was to investigate T2DM as a determinant of PD through a meta-analysis of observational and genetic summary data. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies was undertaken by searching 6 databases. We selected the highest-quality studies investigating the association of T2DM with PD risk and progression. We then used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal effects of genetic liability toward T2DM on PD risk and progression, using summary data derived from genome-wide association studies. Results: In the observational part of the study, pooled effect estimates showed that T2DM was associated with an increased risk of PD (odds ratio [OR] 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07–1.36), and there was some evidence that T2DM was associated with faster progression of motor symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.55, 95% CI 0.39–0.72) and cognitive decline (SMD −0.92, 95% CI −1.50 to −0.34).

We found a quadratic, U-shaped, relationship between aggregate g-ratio and age in most cerebral regions investigated, suggesting myelin maturation until middle age followed by a decrease at older ages. As expected, we observed that these age-related differences vary across different brain regions, with the frontal lobes and parietal lobes exhibiting slightly earlier ages of minimum aggregate g-ratio as compared to more posterior structures such as the occipital lobes and temporal lobes; this agrees with the retrogenesis paradigm. Our results provide evidence for a nonlinear association between age and aggregate g-ratio in a sample of adults from a highly controlled population.

Results: 9,132,176 adults presented with syncope. Syncope in the Northeast (n = 1,831,889) accounted for 20.1% of visits; 22.6% in the Midwest (n = 2,060,940), 38.5% in the South (n = 3,527,814) and 18.7% in the West (n = 1,711,533).

MiRNAs modulate critical brain intracellular signaling pathways and are associated with AD core pathophysiological mechanisms. First, we conducted a real-time quantitative PCR-based pilot study to identify a set of brain-enriched miRNAs in a monocentric cohort of cognitively normal individuals with subjective memory complaints, a condition associated with increased risk of AD. Second, we investigated the impact of age, sex, and the Apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) allele, on the identified miRNA plasma concentrations. In addition, we explored the cross-sectional and longitudinal association of the miRNAs plasma concentrations with regional brain metabolic uptake using amyloid-β (Aβ)-positron emission tomography (Aβ-PET) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (18F-FDG-PET). We identified a set of six brain-enriched miRNAs—miRNA-125b, miRNA-146a, miRNA-15b, miRNA-148a, miRNA-26b, and miRNA-100. Age, sex, and APOE ε4 allele were not associated with individual miRNA abundance. MiRNA-15b concentrations were significantly lower in the Aβ-PET-positive compared to Aβ-PET-negative individuals. Furthermore, we found a positive effect of the miRNA-15b*time interaction on regional metabolic 18F-FDG-PET uptake in the left hippocampus. Plasma miRNA-125b concentrations, as well as the miRNA-125b*time interaction (over a 2-year follow-up), were negatively associated with regional Aβ-PET standard uptake value ratio in the right anterior cingulate cortex. At baseline, we found a significantly negative association between plasma miRNA-125b concentrations and 18F-FDG-PET uptake in specific brain regions.

The underlying molecular mechanisms of cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms remain controversial. Methods: The present study examines behaviors in transgenic models that express Rheb, the most proximal known activator of mTORC1, and profiles striatal phosphoproteomics in a model with persistently elevated mTORC1 signaling. Biochemistry, immunohistochemistry, electrophysiology, and behavior approaches are used to examine the impact of persistently elevated mTORC1 on D1 dopamine receptor (D1R) signaling. The effect of persistently elevated mTORC1 was confirmed using D1-Cre to elevate mTORC1 activity in D1R neurons. Results: We report that persistently elevated mTORC1 signaling blocks canonical D1R signaling that is dependent on DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cAMP-regulated neuronal phosphoprotein). The immediate downstream effector of mTORC1, ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), phosphorylates and activates DARPP-32. Persistent elevation of mTORC1-S6K1 occludes dynamic D1R signaling downstream of DARPP-32 and blocks multiple D1R responses, including dynamic gene expression, D1R-dependent corticostriatal plasticity, and D1R behavioral responses including sociability. Candidate biomarkers of mTORC1–DARPP-32 occlusion are increased in the brain of human disease subjects in association with elevated mTORC1-S6K1, supporting a role for this mechanism in cognitive disease.

Interactions were evaluated using both a 1 degree of freedom (DF) interaction term and a 2DF joint test of genetic and interaction effects.

Systemic biomarkers implicated in learning and memory, including the myokine Cathepsin B (CTSB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and klotho, as well as metabolomics were evaluated. Here we show that aerobic exercise training increases plasma CTSB and that changes in CTSB, but not BDNF or klotho, correlate with cognitive performance. BDNF levels decreased with exercise training. Klotho levels were unchanged by training, but closely associated with change in VO2peak.

Multiple metabolites (~30%) correlated with changes in BDNF, but not CSTB or klotho. The positive association between CTSB and cognition, and the modulation of lipid metabolites implicated in dementia, support the beneficial effects of exercise training on brain function.

Thirty-eight proteins were associated with incident dementia after Bonferroni correction. Of these, 16 were also associated with late-life dementia risk when measured in plasma collected nearly 20 years earlier, during mid-life. Two-sample Mendelian randomization causally implicated two dementia-associated proteins (SVEP1 and angiostatin) in Alzheimer’s disease. SVEP1, an immunologically relevant cellular adhesion protein, was found to be part of larger dementia-associated protein networks, and circulating levels were associated with atrophy in brain regions vulnerable to Alzheimer’s pathology.

We tested whether dysregulation of cholesterol catabolism, through its conversion to primary bile acids (BAs), was associated with dementia pathogenesis. Methods and findings We used a 3-step study design to examine the role of the primary BAs, cholic acid (CA), and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as well as their principal biosynthetic precursor, 7α-hydroxy-cholesterol (7α-OHC), in dementia. In Step 1, we tested whether serum markers of cholesterol catabolism were associated with brain amyloid accumulation, white matter lesions (WMLs), and brain atrophy. In Step 2, we tested whether exposure to bile acid sequestrants (BAS) was associated with risk of dementia. In Step 3, we examined plausible mechanisms underlying these findings by testing whether brain levels of primary BAs and gene expression of their principal receptors are altered in AD. • Step 1: We assayed serum concentrations CA, CDCA, and 7α-OHC and used linear regression and mixed effects models to test their associations with brain amyloid accumulation (N = 141), WMLs, and brain atrophy (N = 134) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). The BLSA is an ongoing, community-based cohort study that began in 1958. Participants in the BLSA neuroimaging sample were approximately 46% male with a mean age of 76 years; longitudinal analyses included an average of 2.5 follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) visits. We used the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (N = 1,666) to validate longitudinal neuroimaging results in BLSA. ADNI is an ongoing, community-based cohort study that began in 2003. Participants were approximately 55% male with a mean age of 74 years; longitudinal analyses included an average of 5.2 follow-up MRI visits. Lower serum concentrations of 7α-OHC, CA, and CDCA were associated with higher brain amyloid deposition (p = 0.041), faster WML accumulation (p = 0.050), and faster brain atrophy mainly (false discovery rate [FDR] p = <0.001–0.013) in males in BLSA. In ADNI, we found a modest sex-specific effect indicating that lower serum concentrations of CA and CDCA were associated with faster brain atrophy (FDR p = 0.049) in males. • Step 2: In the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) dataset, covering >4 million registrants from general practice clinics in the United Kingdom, we tested whether patients using BAS (BAS users; 3,208 with ≥2 prescriptions), which reduce circulating BAs and increase cholesterol catabolism, had altered dementia risk compared to those on non-statin lipid-modifying therapies (LMT users; 23,483 with ≥2 prescriptions). Patients in the study (BAS/ LMT) were approximately 34%/38% male and with a mean age of 65/68 years; follow-up time was 4.7/5.7 years. We found that BAS use was not significantly associated with risk of all-cause dementia (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.72–1.46, p = 0.88) or its subtypes. We found a significant difference between the risk of VaD in males compared to females (p = 0.040) and a significant dose–response relationship between BAS use and risk of VaD (p-trend = 0.045) in males. • Step 3: We assayed brain tissue concentrations of CA and CDCA comparing AD and control (CON) samples in the BLSA autopsy cohort (N = 29). Participants in the BLSA autopsy cohort (AD/CON) were approximately 50%/77% male with a mean age of 87/82 years. We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data to compare brain BA receptor gene expression between AD and CON samples from the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohort (N = 46). ROSMAP is an ongoing, community-based cohort study that began in 1994. Participants (AD/CON) were approximately 56%/36% male with a mean age of 85/85 years. In BLSA, we found that CA and CDCA were detectable in postmortem brain tissue samples and were marginally higher in AD samples compared to CON. In ROSMAP, we found sex-specific differences in altered neuronal gene expression of BA receptors in AD. Study limitations include the small sample sizes in the BLSA cohort and likely inaccuracies in the clinical diagnosis of dementia subtypes in primary care settings. Conclusions We combined targeted metabolomics in serum and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and MRI of the brain with pharmacoepidemiologic analysis to implicate dysregulation of cholesterol catabolism in dementia pathogenesis. We observed that lower serum BA concentration mainly in males is associated with neuroimaging markers of dementia, and pharmacological lowering of BA levels may be associated with higher risk of VaD in males. We hypothesize that dysregulation of BA signaling pathways in the brain may represent a plausible biologic mechanism underlying these results.

Results We observed that: 1) African Americans experienced all forms of discrimination more frequently than Whites, but this finding was qualified by interactions of race with age, gender, and/or poverty status; 2) older African Americans, particularly African American men, and African American men living in poverty reported the greatest lifetime discrimination burden; 3) older African Americans reported greater racial discrimination and greater frequency of multiple social status-based discrimination than younger African Americans; 4) African American men reported greater racial and everyday discrimination and a greater frequency of social status discrimination than African American women; and, 5) White women reported greater frequency of discrimination than White men.

We aimed to evaluate the association of poor olfaction and the risk of any, first-ever, and recurrent pneumonia hospitalisation, as well as death due to pneumonia, in a biracial, community-based cohort of older adults. Methods: For this cohort study, we included participants from the Health, Aging and Body Composition study who were followed up with annual clinic or home visits and semi-annual or quarterly telephone interviews. These individuals completed an olfaction test using the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT) in 1999–2000. Olfaction was defined as good (test score 11–12), moderate (9–10), or poor (0–8). Participants were followed up from baseline until the date of pneumonia hospitalisation, death, last contact, or the end of 13 years of follow-up, whichever came first. We excluded participants who had missing B-SIT scores or missing covariate data from our primary analysis. The primary outcome was total and first-ever hospitalisation due to pneumonia. Findings: 2494 participants aged 71–82 years (mean 75·6 years, SD 2·8) were included in our primary analysis; 1207 (48·4%) were men, 1287 (51·6%) were women; 956 (38·3%) were Black, and 1538 (61·7%) were White. During a median of 12·1 years (IQR 7·4–13·0) of follow-up, we identified a total of 801 hospitalisations due to pneumonia from 537 (21·5%) participants. Of these, 357 (66·5%) had their first-ever event during follow-up. After accounting for potential confounding from demographics, lifestyle factors, health-related conditions, and the competing risk of death, participants with poor olfaction had a higher rate of total pneumonia hospitalisations than that of those with good olfaction (intensity ratio [IR] 1·46, 95% CI 1·22–1·75; p<0·0001). Additionally, poor olfaction was associated with a higher rate for first-ever pneumonia hospitalisation (hazard ratio [HR] 1·37, 95% CI 1·06–1·79; p=0·019). Moderate olfaction was not associated with a higher rate of total (IR 1·05, 0·87–1·26; p=0·62) or first-ever pneumonia hospitalisation (HR 0·97, 0·74–1·26; p=0·79). Results were similar across sex or race subgroups. Interpretation: To our knowledge, this study provides the first epidemiological evidence that poor olfaction is associated with a long-term higher risk of pneumonia in older adults. Future studies should independently confirm this observation, investigate potential mechanisms, and understand its implications for the health of older adults.

CTX-M-type enzymes are an important group of class A extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs). ESBLs are the enzymes that arm bacterial pathogens with drug resistance to an array of antibiotics, notably the advanced-generation cephalosporins. The current need for an effective CTX-M-inhibitor is high. Objective: The aim of the current study was to identify a promising anti-CTX-M-15 ligand whose chemical skeleton could be used as a ‘seed-molecule’ for future drug design against resistant bacteria. Methods: Virtual screening of 5,000,000 test molecules was performed by ‘MCULE Drug Discovery Platform’. ‘ADME analyses’ was performed by ‘SWISS ADME’. TOXICITY CHECKER of MCULE was employed to predict the safety profile of the test molecules. The complex of the ‘Top inhibitor’ with the ‘bacterial CTX-M-15 enzyme’ was subjected to 102.25 ns molecular dynamics simulation. This simulation was run for 3 days on a HP ZR30w workstation. Trajectory analyses were performed by employing the macro ‘md_analyze.mcr’ of YASARA STRUCTURE version 20.12.24.W.64 using AMBER14 force field. YANACONDA macro language was used for complex tasks. Figures, including RMSD and RMSF plots, were generated. Snapshots were acquired after every 250 ps. Finally, two short videos of ‘41 s’ and ‘1 min and 22 s’ duration were recorded. Results: 5-Amino-1-(2H-[1,2,4]triazino[5,6-b]indol-3-yl)-1H-pyrazole-4-carbonitrile, denoted by the MCULE-1352214421-0-56, displayed the most efficient binding with bacterial CTX-M-15 enzyme. This screened molecule significantly interacted with CTX-M-15 via 13 amino acid residues. Notably, nine amino acid residues were found common to avibactam binding (the reference ligand). Trajectory analysis yielded 410 snapshots. The RMSD plot revealed that around 26 ns, equilibrium was achieved and, thereafter, the complex remained reasonably stable. After a duration of 26 ns and onwards until 102.25 ns, the backbone RMSD fluctuations were found to be confined within a range of 0.8–1.4 Å. Conclusion: 5-Amino-1-(2H-[1,2,4]triazino[5,6-b]indol-3-yl)-1H-pyrazole-4-carbonitrile could emerge as a promising seed molecule for CTX-M-15-inhibitor design.

However, it is unclear to what extent pathways reflective of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology are affected by hypertension control. Objective: To evaluate the association of intensive blood pressure control on AD-related brain biomarkers. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a substudy of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT MIND), a multicenter randomized clinical trial that compared the efficacy of 2 different blood pressure-lowering strategies. Potential participants (n = 1267) 50 years or older with hypertension and without a history of diabetes or stroke were approached for a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. Of these, 205 participants were deemed ineligible and 269 did not agree to participate; 673 and 454 participants completed brain MRI at baseline and at 4-year follow-up, respectively; the final follow-up date was July 1, 2016. Analysis began September 2019 and ended November 2020. Interventions: Participants were randomized to either a systolic blood pressure goal of less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment: n = 356) or less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment: n = 317). Main Outcomes and Measures: Changes in hippocampal volume, measures of AD regional atrophy, posterior cingulate cerebral blood flow, and mean fractional anisotropy in the cingulum bundle. Results: Among 673 recruited patients who had baseline MRI (mean [SD] age, 67.3 [8.2] years; 271 women [40.3%]), 454 completed the follow-up MRI at a median (interquartile range) of 3.98 (3.7-4.1) years after randomization. In the intensive treatment group, mean hippocampal volume decreased from 7.45 cm3 to 7.39 cm3(difference, -0.06 cm3; 95% CI, -0.08 to -0.04) vs a decrease from 7.48 cm3 to 7.46 cm3(difference, -0.02 cm3; 95% CI, -0.05 to -0.003) in the standard treatment group (between-group difference in change, -0.033 cm3; 95% CI, -0.062 to -0.003; P =.03). There were no significant treatment group differences for measures of AD regional atrophy, cerebral blood flow, or mean fractional anisotropy. Conclusions and Relevance: Intensive treatment was associated with a small but statistically significant greater decrease in hippocampal volume compared with standard treatment, consistent with the observation that intensive treatment is associated with greater decreases in total brain volume. However, intensive treatment was not associated with changes in any of the other MRI biomarkers of AD compared with standard treatment.

We studied enrichment of common variant heritability for Parkinson's disease stratified by immune and brain cell types. Methods: We used summary statistics from the most recent meta-analysis of genomewide association studies in Parkinson's disease and partitioned heritability using linkage disequilibrium score regression, stratified for specific cell types, as defined by open chromatin regions. We also validated enrichment results using a polygenic risk score approach and intersected disease-associated variants with epigenetic data and expression quantitative loci to nominate and explore a putative microglial locus. Results: We found significant enrichment of Parkinson's disease risk heritability in open chromatin regions of microglia and monocytes. Genomic annotations overlapped substantially between these 2 cell types, and only the enrichment signal for microglia remained significant in a joint model. We present evidence suggesting P2RY12, a key microglial gene and target for the antithrombotic agent clopidogrel, as the likely driver of a significant Parkinson's disease association signal on chromosome 3. Interpretation: Our results provide further support for the importance of immune mechanisms in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, highlight microglial dysregulation as a contributing etiological factor, and nominate a targetable microglial gene candidate as a pathogenic player. Immune processes can be modulated by therapy, with potentially important clinical implications for future treatment in Parkinson's disease.

However, most cognitively stimulating tasks require good vision, potentially affecting the ability of visually impaired adults to engage in these activities. We examined the relationship between vision and participation in cognitively stimulating activities. Method: Data from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study (1999-2005) were analyzed. Associations between visual function (visual acuity [VA], contrast sensitivity [CS], and stereo acuity [SA] impairments) and annual rates of change in number of cognitively stimulating activities (by self-report) performed at least once a month were examined. Results: Analyses included 924 participants aged 75.2 ± 2.8 years.

Isolated, elevated TSH in this population can be consistent with aging-related adaptations rather than indicative of primary thyroid disease, raising the possibility that thyroid hormone replacement may be harmful. Objectives: Determine the association between all-cause mortality and levothyroxine use among older adults. Design: Longitudinal observational study. Setting: Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Participants: One thousand two hundred and fifty eight community dwelling adult participants aged 65+ with an average of 9 years of follow up. Measurements: Thyroid and pituitary hormone levels and thyroid hormone supplementation were determined at each visit. Incident rate ratios (IRR) for all-cause mortality were calculated using time-dependent Poisson regression models to accommodate the varying start times. To isolate the effects of hormone replacement from its effects on TSH, the association between treatment and all-cause mortality was analyzed in participants with stable thyroid function status throughout follow-up (N = 638). Results: Thyroid hormone supplementation was not associated with a significant increase all-cause mortality in the subsequent year in the fully adjusted model (IRR = 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.93–2.12). In a stratified analysis of euthyroid participants, thyroid hormone use was associated with significantly greater mortality, with an adjusted IRR = 1.81 (95% CI = 1.10–2.98). Conclusion: The increased mortality associated with thyroid hormone use among the subclass of euthyroid community dwelling older adults is consistent with a model in which TSH elevation can result from a variety of underlying pathophysiologic processes, not all of which should be treated with thyroid hormone supplementation.

It might be influenced by environmental and genetic factors via the modulation of DNA methylation (DNAm) at CpG-sites. Hence, we combined an epigenetic and genetic approach to test the hypothesis that some common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at CpG-sites (CpG-SNPs) could modify ALS age of onset. Our genome-wide DNAm analysis suggested three CpG-SNPs whose DNAm levels are significantly associated with age of onset in 249 ALS patients (q < 0.05). Next, genetic analysis validated the association of rs4970944 with age of onset in the discovery (n = 469; P = 0.025) and replication (n = 4160; P = 0.007) ALS cohorts. A meta-analysis of the cohorts combined showed that the median onset in AA-carriers is two years later than in GG-carriers (n = 4629; P = 0.0012). A similar association was observed with its tagging SNPs, implicating a 16 Kb region at the 1q21.3 locus as a modifier of ALS age of onset. Notably, rs4970944 genotypes are also associated with age of onset in C9orf72-carriers (n = 333; P = 0.025), suggesting that each A-allele delays onset by 1.6 years. Analysis of Genotype-Tissue Expression data revealed that the protective A-allele is linked with the reduced expression of CTSS in cerebellum (P = 0.00018), which is a critical brain region in the distributed neural circuits subserving motor control. CTSS encodes cathepsin S protein playing a key role in antigen presentation. In conclusion, we identified a 16 Kb locus tagged by rs4970944 as a modifier of ALS age of onset. Our findings support the role of antigen presenting processes in modulating age of onset of ALS and suggest potential drug targets (eg, CTSS).

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based cross-sectional study used National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data collected in the 2003 to 2004 cycle and analyzed in 2017 to 2020. Participants aged 60 to 69 years with complete audiometry, physical activity, and comorbidity data were included in the analysis. Data analysis was performed from January 2017 to December 2020. EXPOSURES Hearing defined by the pure tone average (PTA; range, 0.5-4 kHz) in the better ear, with normal PTA defined as less than 25 dB hearing loss, mild hearing loss defined as PTA 25 to less than 40 dB hearing loss, and moderate or greater hearing loss defined as a PTA greater than or equal to 40 dB hearing loss. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were comprehensive metrics of objectively measured physical activity, including time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, light-intensity physical activity, and sedentary behavior, and physical activity fragmentation. Linear regression was used to model the association between hearing loss and physical activity. RESULTS Of the 291 participants (mean [SD] age, 64.53 [2.96] years), 139 (47.8%) were male, 48 (16.5%) had mild hearing loss, and 22 (7.6%) had moderate or greater hearing loss. After adjusting for age, sex, education, race/ethnicity, and comorbidities, hearing loss (vs normal hearing) was significantly associated with less time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity by 5.53 minutes per day (95% CI, −10.15 to −0.90 minutes per day), less time spent in light-intensity physical activity by 28.55 minutes per day (95% CI, −53.07 to −4.02 minutes per day), more time spent in sedentary behaviors by 34.07 minutes per day (95% CI, 8.32 to 59.82 minutes per day), and more fragmented physical activity pattern by 0.38 SD higher in active-to-sedentary transition probability (95% CI, to 0.10 to 0.65). The magnitude of the association of hearing loss (vs normal hearing) with physical activity metrics was equivalent to 7.28 years (95% CI, 3.19 to 11.37 years) of accelerated age for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, 5.84 years (95% CI, 1.45 to 10.23 years) of accelerated age for light-intensity physical activity, and 10.53 years (95% CI, 2.89 to 18.16 years) of accelerated age for degree of physical activity fragmentation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that hearing loss is associated with a worse physical activity profile. Whether interventions to address hearing loss in adults could improve physical activity profiles will require further study.",51,33871617,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,21100900345,NIA,undefined,National Institute on Aging,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,301,NA,NA,NA

However, some SANC do not fire APs (dormant SANC). Prior studies have shown that β-adrenoceptor stimulation can restore AP firing in these cells. Here we tested whether this relates to improvement of synchronization of clock coupling. We characterized membrane potential, ion currents, Ca2+ dynamics, and phospholamban (PLB) phosphorylation, regulating Ca2+ pump in enzymatically isolated single guinea pig SANC prior to, during, and following β-adrenoceptor stimulation (isoproterenol) or application of cell-permeant cAMP (CPT-cAMP). Phosphorylation of PLB (Serine 16) was quantified in the same cells following Ca2+ measurement. In dormant SANC LCRs were small and disorganized at baseline, membrane potential was depolarized (−38 ± 1 mV, n = 46), and ICaL, If, and IK densities were smaller vs SANC firing APs. β-adrenoceptor stimulation or application of CPT-cAMP led to de novo spontaneous AP generation in 44 and 46% of dormant SANC, respectively. The initial response was an increase in size, rhythmicity and synchronization of LCRs, paralleled with membrane hyperpolarization and small amplitude APs (rate ∼1 Hz). During the transition to steady-state AP firing, LCR size further increased, while LCR period shortened. LCRs became more synchronized resulting in the growth of an ensemble LCR signal peaked in late diastole, culminating in AP ignition; the rate of diastolic depolarization, AP amplitude, and AP firing rate increased. ICaL, IK, and If amplitudes in dormant SANC increased in response to β-adrenoceptor stimulation. During washout, all changes reversed in order. Total PLB was higher, but the ratio of phosphorylated PLB (Serine 16) to total PLB was lower in dormant SANC. β-adrenoceptor stimulation increased this ratio in AP-firing cells. Thus, transition of dormant SANC to AP firing is linked to the increased functional coupling of membrane and Ca2+ clock proteins. The transition occurs via (i) an increase in cAMP-mediated phosphorylation of PLB accelerating Ca2+ pumping, (ii) increased spatiotemporal LCR synchronization, yielding a larger diastolic LCR ensemble signal resulting in an earlier increase in diastolic INCX; and (iii) increased current densities of If, ICaL, and IK.",15,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,11,11,21100215107,NIH,undefined,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,302,cardiac automaticity | coupled-oscillator system | dormant cells | pacemaker mechanism | sinoatrial nodal cells,596832,NA

Objective: To determine whether low-intensity home-based walking exercise at a comfortable pace significantly improves walking ability in people with PAD vs high-intensity home-based walking exercise that induces ischemic leg symptoms and vs a nonexercise control. Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter randomized clinical trial conducted at 4 US centers and including 305 participants. Enrollment occurred between September 25, 2015, and December 11, 2019; final follow-up was October 7, 2020. Interventions: Participants with PAD were randomized to low-intensity walking exercise (n = 116), high-intensity walking exercise (n = 124), or nonexercise control (n = 65) for 12 months. Both exercise groups were asked to walk for exercise in an unsupervised setting 5 times per week for up to 50 minutes per session wearing an accelerometer to document exercise intensity and time. The low-intensity group walked at a pace without ischemic leg symptoms. The high-intensity group walked at a pace eliciting moderate to severe ischemic leg symptoms. Accelerometer data were viewable to a coach who telephoned participants weekly for 12 months and helped them adhere to their prescribed exercise. The nonexercise control group received weekly educational telephone calls for 12 months. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was mean change in 6-minute walk distance at 12 months (minimum clinically important difference, 8-20 m). Results: Among 305 randomized patients (mean age, 69.3 [SD, 9.5] years, 146 [47.9%] women, 181 [59.3%] Black patients), 250 (82%) completed 12-month follow-up. The 6-minute walk distance changed from 332.1 m at baseline to 327.5 m at 12-month follow-up in the low-intensity exercise group (within-group mean change, -6.4 m [95% CI, -21.5 to 8.8 m]; P =.34) and from 338.1 m to 371.2 m in the high-intensity exercise group (within-group mean change, 34.5 m [95% CI, 20.1 to 48.9 m]; P <.001) and the mean change for the between-group comparison was -40.9 m (97.5% CI, -61.7 to -20.0 m; P <.001). The 6-minute walk distance changed from 328.1 m at baseline to 317.5 m at 12-month follow-up in the nonexercise control group (within-group mean change, -15.1 m [95% CI, -35.8 to 5.7 m]; P =.10), which was not significantly different from the change in the low-intensity exercise group (between-group mean change, 8.7 m [97.5% CI, -17.0 to 34.4 m]; P =.44). Of 184 serious adverse events, the event rate per participant was 0.64 in the low-intensity group, 0.65 in the high-intensity group, and 0.46 in the nonexercise control group. One serious adverse event in each exercise group was related to study participation. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with PAD, low-intensity home-based exercise was significantly less effective than high-intensity home-based exercise and was not significantly different from the nonexercise control for improving 6-minute walk distance. These results do not support the use of low-intensity home-based walking exercise for improving objectively measured walking performance in patients with PAD.

In heart failure, decreased expression of JPH2 compromises LCC- RyR communication leading to deficient blood-pumping power. In the present study, we found that JPH2 and CAV3 transcription was concurrently regulated by serum response factor (SRF) and myocardin. In cardiomyocytes from torpid ground squirrels, compared with those from euthermic counterparts, myocardin expression was up-regulated, which boosted both JPH2 and CAV3 expression. Transmission electron microscopic imaging showed that the physical coupling between TTs and SRs was tightened during hibernation and after myocardin overexpression.

Loss of mitochondrial function can drive age-related decline in the brain, but little is known about whether improving mitochondrial homeostasis alleviates senescence phenotypes. We demonstrate here that mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence with a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) occur in A-T patient fibroblasts, and in ATM-deficient cells and mice. Senescence is mediated by stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and involves ectopic cytoplasmic DNA. We further show that boosting intracellular NAD+ levels with nicotinamide riboside (NR) prevents senescence and SASP by promoting mitophagy in a PINK1-dependent manner. NR treatment also prevents neurodegeneration, suppresses senescence and neuroinflammation, and improves motor function in Atm−/− mice.

Although HNKs were initially classified as inactive metabolites because of their lack of anesthetic effects, more recent studies have begun to reveal their biologic activities. In particular, (2R,6R)-and (2S6)-HNK exert antidepressant-relevant behavioral and physiologic effects in preclinical models, which ledtoarapid increase in studies seeking to clarify the mechanisms by which HNKs exert their pharmacological effects. To date, the majority of HNK research has focused on the actions of (2R,6R)-HNK because of its robust behavioral actions in tests of antidepressant effectiveness and its limited adverse effects. This review describes HNK pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, as well as the putative cellular, molecular, and synaptic mechanisms thought to underlie their behavioral effects, both following their metabolism from ketamine and after direct administration in preclinical studies. Converging preclinical evidence indicates that HNKs modulate glutamatergic neurotransmission and downstream signaling pathways in several brain regions, including the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Effects on other neurotransmitter systems, as well as possible effects on neurotrophic and inflammatory processes, and energy metabolism, are also discussed.

In animal studies, a link has been established between obesity and impairment of oligodendrocyte maturation, the cells that produce and maintain myelin.

Objectives: To assess the association between obesity and myelin integrity in cerebral white matter using advanced MRI methodology for myelin content imaging. Methods: Studies were performed in the clinical unit of the National Institute on Aging on a cohort of 119 cognitively unimpaired adults. Using advanced MRI methodology, we measured whole-brain myelin water fraction (MWF), a marker of myelin content. Automated brain mapping algorithms and statistical models were used to evaluate the relationships between MWF and obesity, measured using the body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference (WC), in various white matter brain regions. Results: MWF was negatively associated with BMI or WC in all brain regions evaluated. These associations, adjusted for sex, ethnicity, and age, were statistically significant in most brain regions examined (p < 0.05), with higher BMI or WC corresponding to lower myelin content. Finally, in agreement with previous work, MWF exhibited a quadratic, inverted U-shaped, association with age; this is attributed to the process of myelination from youth through middle age, followed by demyelination afterward. Conclusions: These findings suggest that obesity was significantly associated with white matter integrity, and in particular myelin content.

However, other factors that contribute to an individual’s sense of direction have not been well-characterized. Vestibular impairment has been linked to reduced spatial cognitive ability, which encompasses spatial memory and navigation skills. Several studies have shown that vestibular input is necessary for effective spatial cognition, notably accurate spatial navigation ability. These studies have typically considered laboratory-based spatial navigation assessments; however, the influence of vestibular function on variation in real-world sense of direction is unknown.

We hypothesized that a combination of SFN with vitamin D would prove beneficial in colorectal cancer. A combinatorial chemo-preventive strategy was employed to investigate the impact of SFN on chromatin remodeling in colorectal carcinoma. To understand the epigenetics-mediated changes in gene expression in response to SFN and vitamin D, Caco-2 cells were exposed for 24 h to vitamin D (100 nmol L−1) either alone or in combination with SFN and trichostatin A (20 and 1 μmol L−1, respectively) at 70% confluency (proliferating) and after 13 days post-confluency (fully differentiated). Changes to VDR, CYP24A1, CYP27B1 and TRPV6 gene expressions were quantified using real-time PCR-based assays. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor activity was assessed using HDAC I/II assay that measured global changes in acetylation status. RESULTS: In differentiated Caco-2 cells, none of the genes had significant changes from D alone group. D + SFN (P = 0.99) demonstrated an opposing effect from D alone and decreased VDR expression. However, in proliferating Caco-2 cells, D + SFN (P < 0.04) increased VDR expression and decreased CYP27B1 (P < 0.01) more than D alone (P = 0.38 and 0.07, respectively). Although statistically significant, D + SFN (P = 0.01) effect on HDAC inhibitor activity was less than trichostatin A alone group (P < 0.0004) or SFN alone group (P < 0.0014).

Neuropsychiatric disorders have emerged as a global crisis, affecting 1 in 4 people, while neurological disorders are the second leading cause of death in the elderly population worldwide (WHO, 2001; GBD 2016 Neurology Collaborators, 2019). However, there remains an immense deficit in availability of effective drug treatments for most neurological disorders. In fact, for disorders such as depression, placebos and behavioral therapies have equal effectiveness as antidepressants. For neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, drugs that can prevent, slow, or cure the disease have yet to be found. Several non-traditional avenues of drug target identification have emerged with ongoing neurological disease research to meet the need for novel and efficacious treatments. Of these novel avenues is that of neuroinflammation, which has been found to be involved in the progression and pathology of many of the leading neurological disorders. Neuroinflammation is characterized by glial inflammatory factors in certain stages of neurological disorders. Although the meta-analyses have provided evidence of genetic/proteomic upregulation of inflammatory factors in certain stages of neurological disorders. Although the mechanisms underpinning the connections between neuroinflammation and neurological disorders are unclear, and meta-analysis results have shown high sensitivity to factors such as disorder severity and sample type, there is significant evidence of neuroinflammation associations across neurological disorders. In this review, we summarize the role of neuroinflammation in psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and bipolar disorder, as well as in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, and introduce current research on the potential of immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs) as a new treatment strategy for these disorders.",20,NA,Journal,re,Review,100,8,8,21100199812,NIH,S2782046,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,328,IMiDs ® | neurodegenarative diseases | neuroinflammation | neuropsychaitric disorders | pomalidomide | thalidomide,656921,NA

Methods: Genetic variants in the vicinity of TNFRSF1A, the gene encoding TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), were identified as predictive of pharmacologic blockade of TNFR1 signaling by anti-TNF therapy, based on genetic associations with lower circulating C-reactive protein (CRP; GWAS n = 204,402). The effects of TNF-TNFR1 inhibition were estimated for PD risk (ncases/controls = 37,688/981,372) and age at PD onset (n = 28,568) using GWAS data from the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium and 23andMe, Inc.

Lower VeT was associated with higher fatigability at lower levels of kPCr but not at higher kPCr levels (β for interaction = 0.017, p =. 002). kPCr and RER change rate were not significantly associated (p =. 341), but a 0.01/min higher RER change rate was associated with 0.12-point higher fatigability (p =. 001). Poorer mitochondrial function potentially contributes to higher perceived fatigability through higher glucose oxidation and higher anaerobic metabolism. Future studies to further explore the longitudinal mechanisms between these metabolic changes and fatigability are warranted.",13,32803242,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,29559,NIA,P30AG021334,National Institute on Aging,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,340,Fatigue | Metabolism | Mitochondria | Respiratory exchange ratio | Ventilatory threshold,NA,NA

This work examines associations between dietary trajectories in middle age and subsequent impairments in physical function. Method: Data are from 851 participants (61% men, mean age at first dietary assessment = 47 years, range 30-59 years) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. We used latent class analysis to derive dietary trajectories based on adherence to the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI), and further classified them based on tertiles, as poor (score <39.3), intermediate (39.3-48.9), or good (>48.9). Physical function was assessed with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Random effects tobit regression models were used to examine associations between dietary trajectories and later physical function. Results: Two latent classes of AHEI scores were generated and labeled ""greatly improved""or ""moderately improved.""In the greatly improved class, participants showed a trend in overall AHEI score from poor/intermediate to good diet categories across dietary assessments with age, over time. In the moderately improved class, the overall AHEI score shifted from poor to intermediate diet categories over time, and the prevalence of the good diet category remained low. Mean AHEI score between ages 30 and 59 years was higher in the greatly, than moderately, improved class. The moderately improved class had 1.6 points lower SPPB score (indicating poorer physical function) at older age than the greatly improved class (p =. 022).

We examined relationships of vitamin D status with over time changes in patterns of sleep in a longitudinal study of Whites and African-American urban middle-aged adults, while further testing effect modification by age group, sex and race and the potential roles of dietary and supplemental vitamin D. Methods. Data on 1,760 middle-aged participants in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS study: Age range at v2: 33-71y, mean±SD:53.0±8.8, % women: 58.4%, % African-American:60.3%) were used, with complete baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] serum concentration data, initial selected covariates and mediators, and initial and/or follow-up data on five sub-scales (sleep duration, daytime dysfunction, sleep disturbance, sleep latency and sleep quality) of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.

We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of six independent African ancestry cohorts to determine whether previously reported BMD loci identified in European populations were transferable to African ancestry populations. We included nearly 5000 individuals with both genetic data and assessments of BMD. Genotype imputation was conducted using the 1000G reference panel. We assessed single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations with femoral neck and lumbar spine BMD in each cohort separately, then combined results in fixed effects (or random effects if study heterogeneity was high, I2 index >60) inverse variance weighted meta-analyses. In secondary analyses, we conducted locus-based analyses of rare variants using SKAT-O. Mean age ranged from 12 to 68 years. One cohort included only men and another cohort included only women; the proportion of women in the other four cohorts ranged from 52% to 63%. Of 56 BMD loci tested, one locus, 6q25 (C6orf97, p = 8.87 × 10−4), was associated with lumbar spine BMD and two loci, 7q21 (SLC25A13, p = 2.84 × 10−4) and 7q31 (WNT16, p = 2.96 × 10−5), were associated with femoral neck BMD. Effects were in the same direction as previously reported in European ancestry studies and met a Bonferroni-adjusted p value threshold, the criteria for transferability to African ancestry populations. We also found associations that met locus-specific Bonferroni-adjusted p value thresholds in 11q13 (LRP5, p < 2.23 × 10−4), 11q14 (DCDC5, p < 5.35 × 10−5), and 17p13 (SMG6, p < 6.78 × 10−5) that were not tagged by European ancestry index SNPs.

Effects of oxylipins depend on tissue-specific differences in accumulation of precursor polyunsaturated fatty acids and the expression of specific enzymes to transform the precursors. The study of oxylipins in nociception has presented technical challenges leading to critical knowledge gaps in the way these molecules operate in nociception. We applied a systems-based approach to characterize oxylipin precursor fatty acids, and expression of genes coding for proteins involved in biosynthesis, transport, signaling and inactivation of pro- and antinociceptive oxylipins in pain circuit tissues. We further linked these pathways to nociception by demonstrating intraplantar carrageenan injection induced gene expression changes in oxylipin biosynthetic pathways. We determined functional-biochemical relevance of the proposed pathways in rat hind paw and dorsal spinal cord by measuring basal and stimulated levels of oxylipins throughout the time-course of carrageenan-induced inflammation. Finally, when oxylipins were administered by intradermal injection we observed modulation of nociceptive thermal hypersensitivity, providing a functional-behavioral link between oxylipins, their molecular biosynthetic pathways, and involvement in pain and nociception. Together, these findings advance our understanding of molecular lipidomic systems linking oxylipins and their precursors to nociceptive and inflammatory signaling pathways in rats.

The in situ approach is valuable when exploring the mechanisms that govern the beating rate and rhythm of the sinoatrial node (SAN), the heart’s primary pacemaker. SAN beating rate changes on a beat-to-beat basis. However, to date, there are no standard methods and tools for beating rate variability (BRV) analysis from electrograms (EGMs) collected from different mammals, and there is no centralized public database with such recordings. Methods: We used EGM recordings obtained from control SAN tissues of rabbits (n = 9) and mice (n = 30) and from mouse SAN tissues (n = 6) that were exposed to drug intervention. The data were harnessed to develop a beat detector to derive the beat-to-beat interval time series from EGM recordings. We adapted BRV measures from heart rate variability and reported their range for rabbit and mouse. Results: The beat detector algorithm performed with 99% accuracy, sensitivity, and positive predictive value on the test (mouse) and validation (rabbit and mouse) sets. Differences in the frequency band cutoff were found between BRV of SAN tissue vs. heart rate variability (HRV) of in vivo recordings. A significant reduction in power spectrum density existed in the high frequency band, and a relative increase was seen in the low and very low frequency bands. In isolated SAN, the larger animal had a slower beating rate but with lower BRV, which contrasted the phenomena reported for in vivo analysis. Thus, the non-linear inverse relationship between the average HR and HRV is not maintained under in situ conditions. The beat detector, BRV measures, and databases were contributed to the open-source PhysioZoo software (available at: https://physiozoo.com/). Conclusion: Our approach will enable standardization and reproducibility of BRV analysis in mammals. Different trends were found between beating rate and BRV or HRV in isolated SAN tissue vs. recordings collected under in vivo conditions, respectively, implying a complex interaction between the SAN and the autonomic nervous system in determining HRV in vivo.",8,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,21100199812,NIH,undefined,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,352,animal models | electrogram | heart rate variability | pacemaker | sinoatrail node,614141,NA

Recent evidence suggests that free thyroxine (FT4) levels are associated with an increase in systemic arterial stiffness, but little is known about the effects of FT4 at the local level of the common carotid artery. β-stiffness index is a local elastic parameter usually determined by carotid ultrasound imaging. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis in the ProgeNIA cohort, including 4846 subjects across a broad age range. For the purpose of this study, we excluded subjects with increased thyrotropin (TSH) levels and those treated with levothyroxine or thyrostatic. We assessed β stiffness, strain, wall–lumen ratio, carotid cross-sectional area (CSA), and stress and flow in the right common carotid artery. We tested whether FT4, heart rate, and their interactions were associated with carotid parameters. Results: FT4 was positively and independently associated with β stiffness index (β = 0.026, p = 0.041), and had a negative association with strain (β = −0.025, p = 0.009). After adding heart rate and the interaction between FT4 and heart rate to the model, FT4 was still associated with the β stiffness index (β = 0.186, p = 0.06), heart rate was positively associated with the stiffness index (β = 0.389, p < 0.001) as well as their interaction (β = 0.271, p = 0.007).

Although cell-to-cell α-syn transmission is thought to play a key role in the spread of α-syn pathology, the detailed mechanism is still unknown. Neuroinflammation is another key pathological feature of synucleinopathies. Previous studies have identified several immune receptors that mediate neuroinflammation in synucleinopathies, such as Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). However, the species of α-syn aggregates varies from study to study, and how different α-syn aggregate species interact with innate immune receptors has yet to be addressed. Therefore, we investigated whether innate immune receptors can facilitate the uptake of different species of α-syn aggregates. Here, we examined whether stimulation of TLRs could modulate the cellular uptake and degradation of α-syn fibrils despite a lack of direct interaction. We observed that stimulation of TLR2 in vitro accelerated α-syn fibril uptake in neurons and glia while delaying the degradation of α-syn in neurons and astrocytes. Internalized α-syn was rapidly degraded in microglia regardless of whether TLR2 was stimulated. However, cellular α-syn uptake and degradation kinetics were not altered by TLR4 stimulation. In addition, upregulation of TLR2 expression in a synucleinopathy mouse model increased the density of Lewy-body-like inclusions and induced morphological changes in microglia. Together, these results suggest that cell type-specific modulation of TLR2 may be a multifaceted and promising therapeutic strategy for synucleinopathies; inhibition of neuronal and astroglial TLR2 decreases pathogenic α-syn transmission, but activation of microglial TLR2 enhances microglial extracellular α-syn clearance.",27,33594256,Journal,ar,Article,100,12,12,17476,NIH,I01BX004312,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,360,NA,NA,NA

Results: Carriers of rs4841132-A (frequency 2%-19%) do not show increased hepatic steatosis; they have increased liver attenuation indicative of increased glycogen deposition. rs4841132 falls in a noncoding RNA LOC157273 ~190 kb upstream of PPP1R3B. We demonstrate that rs4841132-A increases PPP1R3B through a cis genetic effect. Using CRISPR/Cas9 we engineered a 105-bp deletion including rs4841132-A in human hepatocarcinoma cells that increases PPP1R3B, decreases LOC157273, and increases glycogen perfectly mirroring the human disease.

Method: A total of 616 subjects from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (mean age 66 years) underwent a comprehensive clinical evaluation. Mitochondrial oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle was assessed as post-exercise phosphocreatine recovery time constant by phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Multivariate regression models were employed to determine the cross-sectional association of mitochondrial oxidative capacity with FRS and history of CVD. Results: Decreased mitochondrial oxidative capacity was strongly associated with higher FRS independent of age, body composition, and physical activity. Lower oxidative capacity was also associated with a history of positive of CVD and higher number of CVD events. Conclusions: We speculate that the observed association could reflect the effect of an excessive production of oxidative species by dysfunctional mitochondria. Furthermore, decreased energy production could hamper the functionality of heart and vessels. In turn, a malfunctioning cardiovascular apparatus could fail to deliver the oxygen necessary for optimal mitochondrial energy production, therefore creating a vicious cycle.

Epidemiological and clinical studies have reported potential involvement of autoimmune mechanisms in MSA pathogenesis. However, genetic etiology of this interaction remains unknown. We aimed to investigate genetic overlap between MSA and 7 autoimmune diseases and to identify shared genetic loci. Methods: Genome-wide association study summary statistics of MSA and 7 autoimmune diseases were combined in cross-trait conjunctional false discovery rate analysis to explore overlapping genetic background. Expression of selected candidate genes was compared in transgenic MSA mice and wild-type mice. Genetic variability of candidate genes was further investigated using independent whole-exome genotyping data from large cohorts of MSA and autoimmune disease patients and healthy controls. Results: We observed substantial polygenic overlap between MSA and inflammatory bowel disease and identified 3 shared genetic loci with leading variants upstream of the DENND1B and RSP04 genes, and in intron of the C7 gene. Further, the C7 gene showed significantly dysregulated expression in the degenerating midbrain of transgenic MSA mice compared with wild-type mice and had elevated burden of protein-coding variants in independent MSA and inflammatory bowel disease cohorts. Conclusion: Our study provides evidence of shared genetic etiology between MSA and inflammatory bowel disease with an important role of the C7 gene in both phenotypes, with the implication of immune and gut dysfunction in MSA pathophysiology. © 2020 The Authors.

After decades of research focused on extending lifespan, current efforts seek primarily to promote healthy aging. Recent advances suggest that biological processes linked to aging are more reliable than chronological age to account for an individual’s functional status, i.e. frail or robust. It is becoming increasingly apparent that biological aging may be detectable as a progressive loss of resilience much earlier than the appearance of clinical signs of frailty. In this context, the INSPIRE program was built to identify the mechanisms of accelerated aging and the early biological signs predicting frailty and pathological aging. To address this issue, we designed a cohort of outbred SWISS mice (1576 male and female mice) in which we will continuously monitor spontaneous and voluntary physical activity from 6 to 24 months of age under either normal or high fat/high sucrose diet. At different age points (6, 12, 18, 24 months), multiorgan functional phenotyping will be carried out to identify early signs of organ dysfunction and generate a large biological fluids/feces/organs biobank (100,000 samples). A comprehensive correlation between functional and biological phenotypes will be assessed to determine: 1) the early signs of biological aging and their relationship with chronological age; 2) the role of dietary and exercise interventions on accelerating or decelerating the rate of biological aging; and 3) novel targets for the promotion of healthy aging.

Methods: A prospective cohort of 4782 older adults from the AGES-Reykjavik study. Baseline recruitment took place between 2002 and 2006, and information on hip fractures occurring through 2012 was extracted from clinical records. Using multivariate regression analyses, baseline measures of bone health, physical function, and body composition were compared between those who later experienced hip fractures and to those who did not. Associations with the risk of fractures were quantified using Cox regression. Results: Mean age was 76.3 years at baseline.

These differences largely persisted after further adjustment for bone mineral density (BMD), suggesting that body composition may contribute to the risk of fracture independent of bone health.

Dietary intake of polyphenols appears to be associated with future accelerated deterioration of bone health. Introduction: Polyphenols, micronutrients ingested through plant-based foods, have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and may contribute to osteoporosis prevention. We evaluated associations of high levels of urinary total polyphenols (UTP), a proxy measure of polyphenol intake, with longitudinal changes of bone properties in a representative cohort of free-living participants of the InCHIANTI study. Methods: The InCHIANTI study enrolled representative samples from the registry list of two towns in Tuscany, Italy. Baseline data were collected in 1998 and follow-up visits in 2001 and 2004. Of the 1453 participants enrolled, 956 consented to donate a 24-h urine sample used to assess UTP, had dietary assessment, a physical examination, and underwent a quantitative computerized tomography (pQCT) of the tibia. From pQCT images, we estimated markers of bone mass (BM), diaphyseal design (DD), and material quality (MQ). Mixed models were used to study the relationship between baseline tertiles of UTP with changes of the bone characteristics over the follow-up. Results: At baseline, higher levels of UTP were positively correlated with markers of BM, DD, and MQ. Compared with lower tertile of UTP, participants in the intermediate and highest tertiles had higher cortical bone area, cortical mineral content, and cortical thickness. However, participants in the intermediate and highest UTP tertiles experienced accelerated deterioration of these same parameters over the follow-up compared with those in the lowest UTP tertile.

NO2 (per IQR = 9.86 ppb) was associated with higher odds of being classified in the poor memory (OR = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.17-1.63) and lower odds of being classified with superior memory (OR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.67-0.97).

The remaining are familial PD associated with gene mutations of either autosomal dominant or recessive inheritances. However, the former ones are similar to sporadic PD, and the latter ones are accompanied by impaired mitophagy during the reproductive stage. Since no radical therapies are available for PD, the objective of this paper is to discuss a mechanistic role for amyloidogenic evolvability, a putative physiological function of αS, among PD subtypes, and the potential relevance to therapy. Presumably, αS evolvability might benefit familial PD due to autosomal dominant genes and also sporadic PD during reproduction, which may manifest as neurodegenerative diseases through antagonistic pleiotropy mechanism in aging. Indeed, there are some reports describing that αS prevents apoptosis and mitochondrial alteration under the oxidative stress conditions, notwithstanding myriads of papers on the neuropathology of αS. Importantly, β-synuclein (βS), the nonamyloidogenic homologue of αS, might buffer against evolvability of αS protofibrils associated with neurotoxicity. Finally, it is intriguing to predict that increased αS evolvability through suppression of βS expression might protect against autosomal recessive PD. Collectively, further studies are warranted to better understand αS evolvability in PD pathogenesis, leading to rational therapy development.",2,NA,Journal,re,Review,100,5,5,19700177307,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,382,NA,6318067,NA

Objective: To investigate the relationship between hypertension defined using multiple measures and length of hypertension with brain measure and cognition. Methods: Using participants from the UK Biobank MRI visit with blood pressure measurements (n = 31,513), we examined the cross-sectional relationships between hypertension and duration of hypertension with brain volumes and cognitive tests using generalized linear models adjusted for confounding. Results: Compared with normotensives, hypertensive participants had smaller brain volumes, larger white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and poorer performance on cognitive tests. For total brain, total grey, and hippocampal volumes, those with greatest duration of hypertension had the smallest brain volumes and the largest WMH, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid volumes. For other subcortical and white matter microstructural regions, there was no clear relationship. There were no significant associations between duration of hypertension and cognitive tests.

A method that measures “physiological age” or physiological aging rate independent of chronological age could therefore help elucidate mechanisms of aging and inform an individual’s risk of morbidity and mortality. Here we present machine learning frameworks for inferring individual physiological age from a broad range of biochemical and physiological traits including blood phenotypes (e.g., high-density lipoprotein), cardiovascular functions (e.g., pulse wave velocity) and psychological traits (e.g., neuroticism) as main groups in two population cohorts SardiNIA (~6,100 participants) and InCHIANTI (~1,400 participants). The inferred physiological age was highly correlated with chronological age (R2 > 0.8). We further defined an individual’s physiological aging rate (PAR) as the ratio of the predicted physiological age to the chronological age. Notably, PAR was a significant predictor of survival, indicating an effect of aging rate on mortality. Our trait-based PAR was correlated with DNA methylation-based epigenetic aging score (r = 0.6), suggesting that both scores capture a common aging process. PAR was also substantially heritable (h2~0.3), and a subsequent genome-wide association study of PAR identified significant associations with two genetic loci, one of which is implicated in telomerase activity.

Studies have shown that presenilin-1 (PS1), the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase whose mutation is linked to familial AD (FAD), localizes to the mitochondrial membrane and regulates its homeostasis. Thus, we investigated how five PS1 mutations (A431E, E280A, H163R, M146V, and Δexon9) observed in FAD affect mitochondrial functions. Methods: We used H4 glioblastoma cell lines genetically engineered to inducibly express either the wild-type PS1 or one of the five PS1 mutants in order to examine mitochondrial morphology, dynamics, membrane potential, ATP production, mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAMs), oxidative stress, and bioenergetics. Furthermore, we used brains of PS1M146V knock-in mice, 3xTg-AD mice, and human AD patients in order to investigate the role of PS1 in regulating MAMs formation. Results: Each PS1 mutant exhibited slightly different mitochondrial dysfunction. Δexon9 mutant induced mitochondrial fragmentation while A431E, E280A, H163R, and M146V mutants increased MAMs formation. A431E, E280A, M146V, and Δexon9 mutants also induced mitochondrial ROS production. A431E mutant impaired both complex I and peroxidase activity while M146V mutant only impaired peroxidase activity. All PS1 mutants compromised mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular ATP levels were reduced by A431E, M146V, and Δexon9 mutants. Through comparative profiling of hippocampal gene expression in PS1M146V knock-in mice, we found that PS1M146V upregulates Atlastin 2 (ATL2) expression level, which increases ER-mitochondria contacts. Down-regulation of ATL2 after PS1 mutant induction rescued abnormally elevated ER-mitochondria interactions back to the normal level. Moreover, ATL2 expression levels were significantly elevated in the brains of 3xTg-AD mice and AD patients. Conclusions: Overall, our findings suggest that each of the five FAD-linked PS1 mutations has a deleterious effect on mitochondrial functions in a variety of ways.

As most circRNAs appear not to encode peptides, their function is presumed to be linked to their interaction with a range of molecules, particularly other nucleic acids (notably microRNAs) and proteins. A major impediment to identifying circRNA-associated molecules is a lack of suitable methodologies capable of analyzing specifically circRNAs and not their linear RNA counterparts with which they share most of their sequence.

The affinity pulldown assay is based on the use of a biotinylated antisense oligomer that recognizes the circRNA-specific junction sequence.

Here we characterized the transcriptional changes associated with physiological aging in mouse resident macrophage populations across different tissues and sexes. Although the age-related transcriptomic signatures of resident macrophages were strikingly tissuespecific, the differentially expressed genes were collectively enriched for those with important innate immune functions such as antigen presentation, cytokine production, and cell adhesion. The brain-resident microglia had the most wide-ranging age-related alterations, with compromised expression of tissue-specific genes and relatively exaggerated responses to endotoxin stimulation. Despite the tissue-specific patterns of aging transcriptomes, components of the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway were decreased in aged macrophages across multiple tissues. In vivo suppression of Hh signaling in young animals increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while in vitro activation of Hh signaling in old macrophages, in turn, suppressed the expression of these inflammatory cytokines.

We first examined baseline cholesterol in relation to PD risk, adjusting for potential confounders and competing risk of death. Then, by contrasting the observed with expected cholesterol levels, we examined the trajectory of changes in total cholesterol before and after disease diagnosis. Results: Compared to the lowest tertile of baseline total cholesterol, the cumulative incidence ratio of PD and 95% confidence interval was 0.41 (0.20, 0.86) for the second tertile, and 0.69 (0.35, 1.35) for the third tertile.

In human brain, APN regulation of the evolvability of amyloidogenic proteins (APs), including amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau, in developmental/reproductive stages, might be paradoxically manifest as APN stimulation of AD through antagonistic pleiotropy in aging. The unique mechanisms underlying APN activity remain unclear, a better understanding of which might provide clues for AD therapy. In this paper, we discuss the possible relevance of activin, a member of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily of peptides, to antagonistic pleiotropy effects of APN. Notably, activin, a multiple regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as an endocrine modulator in reproduction and an organizer in early development, might promote aging-associated disorders, such as inflammation and cancer. Indeed, serum activin, but not serum TGFβ increases during aging. Also, activin/TGFβ signal through type II and type I receptors, both of which are transmembrane serine/threonine kinases, and the serine/threonine phosphorylation of APs, including Aβ42 serine 8 and S serine 129, may confer pathological significance in neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, activin expression is induced by APN in monocytes and hepatocytes, suggesting that activin might be situated downstream of the APN paradox. Finally, a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies demonstrated that two SNPs relevant to the activin/TGFβ receptor signaling pathways conferred risk for major aging-associated disease. Collectively, activin might be involved in the APN paradox of AD and could be a significant therapeutic target.",8,33814453,Journal,re,Review,100,8,8,16246,NIA,ZIAAG000936,National Institute on Aging,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,399,Activin | adiponectin paradox | Alzheimer's disease | amyloidogenic proteins | antagonistic pleiotropy | evolvability | transforming growth factor β,NA,NA

We investigated the role of single heterozygous PRKN mutations in three large independent case-control cohorts totalling 10 858 PD cases and 8328 controls. Overall, after exclusion of biallelic carriers, single PRKN mutations were more common in PD than controls conferring a >1.5-fold increase in the risk of PD [P-value (P) = 0.035], with meta-analysis (19 574 PD cases and 468 488 controls) confirming increased risk [Odds ratio (OR) = 1.65, P = 3.69E-07]. Carriers were shown to have significantly younger ages at the onset compared with non-carriers (NeuroX: 56.4 vs. 61.4 years; exome: 38.5 vs. 43.1 years). Stratifying by mutation type, we provide preliminary evidence for a more pathogenic risk profile for single PRKN copy number variant (CNV) carriers compared with single nucleotide variant carriers. Studies that did not assess biallelic PRKN mutations or consist of predominantly early-onset cases may be biasing these estimates, and removal of these resulted in a loss of association (OR = 1.23, P = 0.614; n = 4). Importantly, when we looked for additional CNVs in 30% of PD cases with apparent monoallellic PRKN mutations, we found that 44% had biallelic mutations, suggesting that previous estimates may be influenced by cryptic biallelic mutation status. While this study supports the association of single PRKN mutations with PD, it highlights confounding effects; therefore, caution is needed when interpreting current risk estimates.

Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for bona fide autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide.

Herein, we aimed to directly explore the potential role of neuronal insulin signaling using an innovative technique based on biomarkers derived from plasma extracellular vesicles enriched for neuronal origin (NEVs). We leveraged plasma samples from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week clinical trial evaluating infliximab as a treatment of bipolar depression. We isolated NEVs using immunoprecipitation against neuronal marker L1CAM from samples collected at baseline and weeks 2, 6 and 12 (endpoint) and measured NEV biomarkers using immunoassays. We assessed neuronal insulin signaling at its first node (IRS-1) and along the canonical (Akt, GSK-3β, p70S6K) and alternative (ERK1/2, JNK and p38-MAPK) pathways. A subset of participants (n = 27) also underwent whole-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline and endpoint. Pre-treatment, NEV biomarkers of insulin signaling were independently associated with cognitive function and MRI measures (i.e. hippocampal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex [vmPFC] volumes). In fact, the association between IRS-1 phosphorylation at serine site 312 (pS312-IRS-1), an indicator of insulin resistance, and cognitive dysfunction was mediated by vmPFC volume. In the longitudinal analysis, patients treated with infliximab, a tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonist with known insulin sensitizing properties, compared to those treated with placebo, had augmented phosphorylation of proteins from the alternative pathway. Infliximab responders had significant increases in phosphorylated JNK levels, relative to infliximab non-responders and placebo responders. In addition, treatment with infliximab resulted in increase in MRI measures of brain volume; treatment-related changes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volume were mediated by changes in biomarkers from the insulin alternative pathway. In conclusion, our findings support the idea that brain insulin signaling is a target for further mechanistic and therapeutic investigations.",35,33316649,Journal,ar,Article,100,19,19,16812,NIA,ZIAAG000975,National Institute on Aging,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,412,Bipolar disorders | Cognition | Extracellular vesicles | Inflammation | Insulin | TNF-α,NA,S0022395620311158

Methods: We examined OB patterns and time trends across socio-economic and geographic parameters and projected the future situation. Large national databases were used. Overweight (OW), OB and severe obesity (SOB) were defined using body mass index cut-points/percentiles; central obesity (CO), waist circumference cut-point in adults and waist:height ratio cutoff in youth. Various meta-regression analysis models were fit for projection analyses. Results: OB prevalence had consistently risen since 1999 and considerable differences existed across groups and regions. Among adults, men's OB (33.7%) and OW (71.6%) levelled off in 2009-2012, resuming the increase to 38.0 and 74.7% in 2015-2016, respectively. Women showed an uninterrupted increase in OB/OW prevalence since 1999, reaching 41.5% (OB) and 68.9% (OW) in 2015-2016. SOB levelled off in 2013-2016 (men: 5.5-5.6%; women: 9.7-9.5%), after annual increases of 0.2% between 1999 and 2012. Non-Hispanic Blacks had the highest prevalence in women's OB/SOB and men's SOB. OB prevalence in boys rose continuously to 20.6% and SOB to 7.5% in 2015-2016, but not in girls. By 2030, most Americans will be OB/OW and nearly 50% of adults OB, whereas ~33% of children aged 6-11 and 50% of adolescents aged 12-19 will be OB/ OW. Since 1999, CO has risen steadily, and by 2030 is projected to reach 55.6% in men, 80.0% in women, 47.6% among girls and 38.9% among boys. Regional differences exist in adult OB prevalence (2011-2016) and across ethnicities; South (32.0%) and Midwest (31.4%) had the highest rates.
