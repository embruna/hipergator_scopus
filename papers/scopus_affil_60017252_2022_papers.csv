Control participants included 1,012 geographically matched, age-matched, and sex-matched participants. Clinical and cognitive differences between patients carrying the C/C rs12608932 genotype and those carrying the A/A + A/C genotype were assessed. A subset of patients underwent 18F-FDG-PET.ResultsThe C/C genotype was associated with an increased risk of ALS (odds ratio: 1.54, 95% confidence interval 1.18-2.01, p = 0.001). Patients with the C/C genotype were older, had more frequent bulbar onset, and manifested a higher rate of weight loss. In addition, they showed significantly reduced performance in the letter fluency test, fluency domain of Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen (ECAS) and story-based empathy task (reflecting social cognition). Patients with the C/C genotype had a shorter survival (median survival time, C/C 2.25 years, interquartile range [IQR] 1.33-3.92; A/A + C/C: 2.90 years, IQR 1.74-5.41; p = 0.0001). In Cox multivariable analysis, C/C genotype resulted to be an independent prognostic factor. Finally, patients with a C/C genotype had a specific pattern of hypometabolism on brain 18F-FDG-PET extending to frontal and precentral areas of the right hemisphere.DiscussionC/C rs12608932 genotype of UNC13A is associated with a specific motor and cognitive/behavioral phenotype, which reflects on 18F-FDG-PET findings.

However, the specific molecular mechanisms by which lncRNAs regulate human myogenesis are poorly understood. Here, we identified a novel muscle-specific lncRNA, lncFAM71E1-2:2 (lncFAM), which increased robustly during early human myogenesis. Overexpression of lncFAM promoted differentiation of human myoblasts into myotubes, while silencing lncFAM suppressed this process. As lncFAM resides in the nucleus, chromatin isolation by RNA purification followed by mass spectrometry (ChIRP-MS) analysis was employed to identify the molecular mechanisms whereby it might promote myogenesis. Analysis of lncFAM-interacting proteins revealed that lncFAM recruited the RNA-binding protein HNRNPL to the promoter of MYBPC2, in turn increasing MYBPC2 mRNA transcription and enhancing production of the myogenic protein MYBPC2. These results highlight a mechanism whereby a novel ribonucleoprotein complex, lncFAM-HNRNPL, elevates MYBPC2 expression transcriptionally to promote myogenesis.",9,Journal,ar,Article,100,16,16,NA,14204,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,2,03051048,13026-13044,36533518,NA,NA

Recent high-resolution imaging, however, demonstrated that Ca signals and APs in the SAN are heterogeneous, with many cells generating APs of different rates and rhythms or even remaining non-firing (dormant cells), i.e., generating only subthreshold signals. Here we numerically tested a hypothesis that a community of dormant cells can generate normal automaticity, i.e., “the pacemaker cell” is not required to initiate rhythmic cardiac impulses. Our model includes 1) non-excitable cells generating oscillatory local Ca releases and 2) an excitable cell lacking automaticity. While each cell in isolation was not “the pacemaker cell”, the cell system generated rhythmic APs: The subthreshold signals of non-excitable cells were transformed into respective membrane potential oscillations via electrogenic Na/Ca exchange and further transferred and integrated (computed) by the excitable cells to reach its AP threshold, generating rhythmic pacemaking. Cardiac impulse is an emergent property of the SAN cellular network and can be initiated by cells lacking intrinsic automaticity. Cell heterogeneity, weak coupling, subthreshold signals, and their summation are critical properties of the new pacemaker mechanism, i.e., cardiac pacemaker can operate via a signaling process basically similar to that of “temporal summation” happening in a neuron with input from multiple presynaptic cells. The new mechanism, however, does not refute the classical pacemaker cell-based mechanism: both mechanisms can co-exist and interact within SAN tissue.",2,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,1090162,21100215107,NIH,undefined,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,3,NA,NA,NA,diastolic depolarization | heartbeat | local calcium release | pacemaker mechanism | sinoatrial node,NA

Speech-in-noise performance, which reflects central hearing ability, is more limited in prior literature. We examined the longitudinal associations of audiometric hearing and speech-in-noise performance with cognitive decline. Methods: We studied 702 participants aged ≥60 years in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging 2012–2019. Global and domain-specific (language, memory, attention, executive function, visuospatial ability) cognitive performance were assessed by the cognitive assessment battery. Hearing thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kilohertz obtained from pure-tone audiometry were averaged to calculate better-ear pure-tone average (PTA) and participants were categorized as having hearing loss (>25 decibels hearing level [dB HL]) or normal hearing (≤25 dB HL). Speech-in-noise performance was assessed by the Quick Speech-in-Noise (QuickSIN) test, and participants were categorized as having below-median (worse) or above-median performance. Linear mixed effects models with random intercepts and slopes were used to assess baseline cognitive performance and cognitive decline by hearing status. Models adjusted for demographic, lifestyle and disease factors. Results: Participants with audiometric hearing loss showed similar baseline cognitive performance but faster decline in global cognitive function, language, executive function, and attention. Participants with below-median QuickSIN score showed worse baseline cognitive performance in all domains and faster decline in global cognitive function, language, memory, executive function and attention.

It has been shown that stored memories, when retrieved, are susceptible to modification, incorporating new information through an updating process. Catecholamine release in the hippocampal CA1 region consolidates an object location memory (OLM). This work hypothesized that spatial contextual memory updating could be changed by decreasing catecholamine release in the hippocampal CA1 terminals from the locus coeruleus (LC). In a mouse model expressing Cre-recombinase under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter, memory updating was impaired by photoinhibition of the CA1 catecholaminergic terminals from the LC (LC-CA1) but not from the ventral tegmental area (VTA-CA1). In vivo microdialysis confirmed that the extracellular concentration of both dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) decreased after photoinhibition of the LC-CA1 terminals (but not VTA-CA1) during the OLM update session. Furthermore, DA D1/D5 and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists disrupted behavior, but only the former impaired memory updating. Finally, photoinhibition of LC-CA1 terminals suppressed long-term potentiation (LTP) induction in Schaffer’s collaterals as a plausible mechanism for memory updating.

There were no longitudinal differences in CSF and serum biomarkers between NMCs and HCs. Urinary BMP was significantly elevated in NMCs at all time points but did not change longitudinally. Neither baseline biofluid biomarkers nor the presence of DAT deficit correlated with 2-year change in clinical outcomes. We observed no significant 2-year longitudinal change in clinical or biomarker measures in LRRK2 G2019S NMCs in this large, well-characterized cohort even in the participants with baseline DAT deficit.

Methods: The study population included 979 Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants aged ≥50 years (52% female, mean age: 70 10.2 years) with a median follow-up time of 4.7 years. Energy utilisation for walking was operationalised as a ratio of the energy cost of slow walking to peak walking energy expenditure during standardised tasks ('cost-ratio'). Cognitive functioning was measured using the Trail Making Tests, California Verbal Learning Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), letter and category fluency and card rotation tests. Linear mixed models adjusted for demographics, education and co-morbidities assessed the association between baseline cost-ratio and cognitive functioning, cross-sectionally and longitudinally.

Here, we investigated PURPL upon p53 activation in liver cancer cells, where it is expressed at significantly higher levels than other cell types. Using isoform sequencing, we discovered novel PURPL transcripts that have a retained intron and/or previously unannotated exons. To determine PURPL function upon p53 activation, we performed transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) after depleting PURPL using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), followed by Nutlin treatment to induce p53. Strikingly, although loss of PURPL in untreated cells altered the expression of only 7 genes, loss of PURPL resulted in altered expression of;800 genes upon p53 activation, revealing a context-dependent function of PURPL. Pathway analysis suggested that PURPL is important for fine-tuning the expression of specific genes required for mitosis. Consistent with these results, we observed a significant decrease in the percentage of mitotic cells upon PURPL depletion.

However, these group-level observations do not explain the heterogeneous accumulated effects of CVMs on individual neuroanatomy. Multivariate CVM-related changes characterized at the individual level using machine learning (ML)-derived summary indices may better capture their differential roles in brain aging and dementia. In this work, we derive ML-based indices that summarize brain changes from MRI related to CVMs. Method: Cognitively normal volunteers that were pooled and harmonized for the iSTAGING cohort were included in this study (N=24,902 from 8 independent studies, 54.5% female, average age=62.4, age range 45-75 years). Linear support vector classifiers were trained to discriminate between people with a specific CVM from those without the CVM using nested cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning and model selection. Input features (n=150) consisted of age, sex, intracranial volume, harmonized regional GM and WM volumes, and lobar volumes of WM hyperintensities. The resulting distance of the projection onto the vector perpendicular to the decision plane yields a continuous scalar representing ‘spatial pattern of abnormality for recognition’ (SPARE) of each CVM. SPARE-CVMs were computed for each participant and correlated with previously established imaging markers for brain age [Habes 2021] and Alzheimer’s disease (SPARE-AD)[Davatzikos 2009]. Effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were calculated to assess the utility of SPAREs with higher values indicating greater separability between the CVM+ and CVM- groups. Result: Figure 1 shows the distribution, effect sizes and associated brain regions for each SPARE-CVM. SPARE-diabetes and SPARE-hypertension yielded the largest effect sizes. SPAREs for cooccurring CVMs showed higher correlation (Figure 2) and greater corresponding effect sizes (Figure 3). For example, hyperlipidemia was separable by SPARE-hypertension, but not other SPAREs. By contrast, brain age gap (SPARE-BA) and SPARE-AD were unrelated to CVMs. Conclusion: We derived sensitive and partially non-overlapping quantitative indices that characterize the degree of CVM-related neuroanatomical differences in cognitively unimpaired participants.

Concerns exist in the field regarding the feasibility of conducting AD/ADRD CTs outside of academic settings given the testing required within CT protocols. We evaluated recently awarded NIA CTs to document their types and frequency of diagnostic tests required. Findings provide NIA the opportunity to understand the potential test burden on sites and consented participants. Method: We conducted a systematic content analysis of recently funded NIA AD/ADRD CTs involving human subjects to assess the commitment required of participants and the number and type of tests required across protocols (start dates: 2/1/20 – 9/30/2021 (N = 115)). Documented tests included: imaging, biospecimen, genetic, sleep, cognitive, and mental health. Findings were analyzed by the CTs’ standardized Common Alzheimer’s and Related Dementias Research Ontology (CADRO) category. Result: Most CTs (65%) were CADRO C (Translational Research/Clinical Interventions) or E (Dementia Care/Disease Impact; 25%); CADRO E had substantially fewer tests required of participants. Most trials (75%) asked consented participants for less than a year commitment (median = 185 days). Top tests required were cognitive (78% of trials); mental health/well-being (57%); brain imaging (46%; e.g., MRI, PET, MRS), and blood collection (37%). Fewer CTs required lumbar spinal tap (12%). Initial analyses indicate that potentially 75 unique cognitive tests were documented across the 90 CTs assessing cognition, and that participants were asked to complete a median 8.5 cognitive tests per trial (range: 1 to 71 tests). Conclusion: This review lays the foundation for understanding the complexity of recently funded NIA AD/ADRD clinical trials.

This study tests the hypothesis that blood mtDNAcn is related to personality traits and mediates the association between personality and mortality. Methods: We assessed the big five personality domains and facets using the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R), assessed depressive symptoms with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), estimated mtDNAcn levels from whole-genome sequencing, and tracked mortality in participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.

The direction and size of the effects were replicated in the SardiNIA cohort and were robust to adjustment for potential confounders in both samples. Consistent with the Neuroticism finding, higher depressive symptoms were associated with lower mtDNAcn. Finally, mtDNAcn mediated the association between personality and mortality risk.

We used unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods on comprehensive, longitudinal clinical data from the Parkinson’s Disease Progression Marker Initiative (n = 294 cases) to identify patient subtypes and to predict disease progression. The resulting models were validated in an independent, clinically well-characterized cohort from the Parkinson’s Disease Biomarker Program (n = 263 cases).

Cox regression and generalized structural equations models (GSEM) were constructed among adults aged≥60 y at baseline (N = 4,592). Non-Hispanic Black versus White (NHW) adults had higher risk of dementia in age and sex-adjusted Cox regression models (HR = 1.34, 95%CI: 1.15–1.55, P < 0.001), an association that was attenuated in the SES-adjusted model (HR = 1.15, 95%CI: 1.01–1.34, P = 0.092). SES was inversely related to dementia risk overall (per Standard Deviation, HR = 0.80, 95% CI:0.69–0.92, P = 0.002, Model 2), mainly within the middle-income group. Within the lowest and middle-income groups and in socio-economic status (SES)-adjusted models, Mexican American participants were at lower all-cause dementia risk compared with their NHW counterparts.

Furthermore, studies have shown the neuroprotective effect of α-Klotho against neuroinflammation on different conditions, such as aging, animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, and ischemic brain injury. This work aimed to evaluate the effects of α-Klotho protein on primary glial cell culture against the proinflammatory challenge with LPS and how this could interfere with neuronal health. Cortical mixed glial cells and purified astrocytes were pretreated with α- α-Klotho and stimulated with LPS followed by TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ levels, and NF-κB activity analysis. Conditioned medium from cortical mixed glia culture treated with LPS (glia conditioned medium (GCM) was used to induce neuronal death of primary cortical neuronal culture and evaluate if GCM-KL (medium from glia culture pretreated α-Klotho followed by LPS stimulation) or GCM + LPS in the presence of KL can reverse the effect. LPS treatment in glial cells induced an increase in proinflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ, and activation of astrocyte NF-κB. GCM treated-cortical neuronal culture induced a concentration-dependent neuronal death. Pretreatment with α-Klotho decreased TNF-α and IL-6 production, reverted NF-κB activation, and decreased neuronal death induced by GCM. In addition, KL incubation together with GCM + LPS completely reverts the neuronal toxicity induced by low concentration of GCM-LPS.

The regulatory competence of TFs is routinely assessed by detecting target genes to which they bind. However, these data do not indicate which target genes are activated, repressed, or not affected by the change of TF abundance. There is a lack of large-scale studies that compare the genome binding of TFs with the expression change of target genes after manipulation of each TF. Results: In this paper we associated human TFs with their target genes by two criteria: binding to genes, evaluated from published ChIP-seq data (n = 1868); and change of target gene expression shortly after induction of each TF in human ES cells. Lists of direction- and strength-specific regulated target genes are generated for 311 TFs (out of 351 TFs tested) with expected proportion of false positives less than or equal to 0.30, including 63 new TFs not present in four existing databases of target genes. Our lists of direction-specific targets for 152 TFs (80.0%) are larger that in the TRRUST database. In average, 30.9% of genes that respond greater than or equal to twofold to the induction of TFs are regulated targets. Regulated target genes indicate that the majority of TFs are either strong activators or strong repressors, whereas sets of genes that responded greater than or equal to twofold to the induction of TFs did not show strong asymmetry in the direction of expression change. The majority of human TFs (82.1%) regulated their target genes primarily via binding to enhancers. Repression of target genes is more often mediated by promoter-binding than activation of target genes. Enhancer-promoter loops are more abundant among strong activator and repressor TFs. Conclusions: We developed an atlas of regulated targets of TFs (ART-TF) in human ES cells by combining data on TF binding with data on gene expression change after manipulation of individual TFs. Sets of regulated gene targets were identified with a controlled rate of false positives. This approach contributes to the understanding of biological functions of TFs and organization of gene regulatory networks.

ConQuR is a comprehensive method that accommodates the complex distributions of microbial read counts by non-parametric modeling, and it generates batch-removed zero-inflated read counts that can be used in and benefit usual subsequent analyses.

Assessing these alterations has become a topic of increasing interest. However, a few studies have examined different stages of AD from a complex network perspective that cover different topological scales. This study used resting state fMRI data to analyze the trend of functional connectivity alterations from a cognitively normal (CN) state through early and late mild cognitive impairment (EMCI and LMCI) and to Alzheimer’s disease. The analyses had been done at the local (hubs and activated links and areas), meso (clustering, assortativity, and rich-club), and global (small-world, small-worldness, and efficiency) topological scales. The results showed that the trends of changes in the topological architecture of the functional brain network were not entirely proportional to the AD progression. There were network characteristics that have changed non-linearly regarding the disease progression, especially at the earliest stage of the disease, i.e., EMCI. Further, it has been indicated that the diseased groups engaged somatomotor, frontoparietal, and default mode modules compared to the CN group.

Multiple methods have been recently developed that can identify repeat expansions in whole genome or exome sequencing data. Despite the widely recognized need for visual assessment of variant calls in clinical settings, current computational tools lack the ability to produce such visualizations for repeat expansions. Expanded repeats are difficult to visualize because they correspond to large insertions relative to the reference genome and involve many misaligning and ambiguously aligning reads. Results: We implemented REViewer, a computational method for visualization of sequencing data in genomic regions containing long repeat expansions and FlipBook, a companion image viewer designed for manual curation of large collections of REViewer images. To generate a read pileup, REViewer reconstructs local haplotype sequences and distributes reads to these haplotypes in a way that is most consistent with the fragment lengths and evenness of read coverage. To create appropriate training materials for onboarding new users, we performed a concordance study involving 12 scientists involved in short tandem repeat research. We used the results of this study to create a user guide that describes the basic principles of using REViewer as well as a guide to the typical features of read pileups that correspond to low confidence repeat genotype calls. Additionally, we demonstrated that REViewer can be used to annotate clinically relevant repeat interruptions by comparing visual assessment results of 44 FMR1 repeat alleles with the results of triplet repeat primed PCR. For 38 of these alleles, the results of visual assessment were consistent with triplet repeat primed PCR. Conclusions: Read pileup plots generated by REViewer offer an intuitive way to visualize sequencing data in regions containing long repeat expansions. Laboratories can use REViewer and FlipBook to assess the quality of repeat genotype calls as well as to visually detect interruptions or other imperfections in the repeat sequence and the surrounding flanking regions.

A 1:1 propensity score matching was performed generating a cohort of 1.572 patients (786 treated [AChEIs +] and 786 not treated [AChEIs-] with AChEIs. The MMSE score was almost stable during the first 6 years of follow up in AChEIs + and then declined, while in AChEIs− it progressively declined so that at the end of follow-up (13.6 years) the average decrease in MMSE was 10.8 points in AChEIs- compared with 5.4 points in AChEIs + (p < 0.001). This trend was driven by LOAD (Δ-MMSE:−10.8 vs. −5.7 points; p < 0.001), although a similar effect was observed in VD (Δ-MMSE:−11.6 vs. −8.8; p < 0.001).

At multivariate Cox regression analysis (adjusted for age, gender, dependency level and depression) a strong association between AChEIs therapy and lower all-cause mortality was observed (H.R.:0.59; 95%CI: 0.53–0.66); this was confirmed also in analyses separately conducted in LOAD, VD and LBD. Among older people with dementia, treatment with AChEIs was associated with a slower cognitive decline and with reduced mortality, after a mean follow-up of almost eight years.

Mutations in LRRK2 cause autosomal-dominant forms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Heterozygous mutations in GBA1, the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), are the most common genetic risk factors for PD. Moreover, GCase function is altered in idiopathic PD and in other genetic forms of the disease. Recent work suggests that LRRK2 kinase activity can regulate GCase function. However, both a positive and a negative correlation have been described. To gain insights into the impact of LRRK2 on GCase, we performed a comprehensive analysis of GCase levels and activity in complementary LRRK2 models, including (i) LRRK2 G2019S knock in (GSKI) mice, (ii) peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs), plasma, and fibroblasts from PD patients carrying LRRK2 G2019S mutation, (iii) patient iPSCs-derived neurons; (iv) endogenous and overexpressed cell models. In some of these models we found a positive correlation between the activities of LRRK2 and GCase, which was further confirmed in cell lines with genetic and pharmacological manipulation of LRRK2 kinase activity. GCase protein level is reduced in GSKI brain tissues and in G2019S iPSCs-derived neurons, but increased in fibroblasts and PBMCs from patients, suggesting cell-type-specific effects. Overall, our study indicates that LRRK2 kinase activity affects both the levels and the catalytic activity of GCase in a cell-type-specific manner, with important implications in the context of therapeutic application of LRRK2 inhibitors in GBA1-linked and idiopathic PD.",19,Journal,ar,Article,100,19,19,92,21100982311,NIA,ZIAAG000948,National Institute on Aging,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,61,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Methods: To better understand the genetic contribution of this region to PD and to identify novel mechanisms conferring risk for the disease, we fine-mapped the 17q21.31 locus by constructing discrete haplotype blocks from genetic data. We used digital PCR to assess copy number variation associated with PD-associated blocks, and used human brain postmortem RNA-seq data to identify candidate genes that were then further investigated using in vitro models and human brain tissue. Results: We identified three novel H1 sub-haplotype blocks across the 17q21.31 locus associated with PD risk. Protective sub-haplotypes were associated with increased LRRC37A/2 copy number and expression in human brain tissue. We found that LRRC37A/2 is a membrane-associated protein that plays a role in cellular migration, chemotaxis and astroglial inflammation. In human substantia nigra, LRRC37A/2 was primarily expressed in astrocytes, interacted directly with soluble α-synuclein, and co-localized with Lewy bodies in PD brain tissue. Conclusion: These data indicate that a novel candidate gene, LRRC37A/2, contributes to the association between the 17q21.31 locus and PD via its interaction with α-synuclein and its effects on astrocytic function and inflammatory response. These data are the first to associate the genetic association at the 17q21.31 locus with PD pathology, and highlight the importance of variation at the 17q21.31 locus in the regulation of multiple genes other than MAPT and KANSL1, as well as its relevance to non-neuronal cell types.",20,Journal,ar,Article,100,20,20,48,5700191214,NIH,P01 AG026276,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,62,NA,NA,35841044,17q21.31 | Astrocytes | Copy number variation | LRRC37A | Parkinson’s disease,NA

We propose to capture temporally local distributional information in wearable data using subject-specific time-by-distribution (TD) data objects. Specifically, we develop scalar on time-by-distribution regression (SOTDR) to model associations between scalar response of interest such as health outcomes or disease status and TD predictors. Additionally, we show that TD data objects can be parsimoniously represented via a collection of time-varying L-moments that capture distributional changes over the time-of-day.

We found that mild AD is significantly associated with reduced upper quantile levels of physical activity, particularly during morning hours. In-sample cross validation demonstrated that TD predictors attain much stronger associations with clinical cognitive scales of attention, verbal memory, and executive function when compared to predictors summarized via scalar total activity counts, temporal functional curves, and quantile functions.

Prior to 21 months of age, time-dependent changes in intrinsic RR interval variability and mean RR interval were relatively minor. Between 21 and 30 months of age, however, marked changes emerged in intrinsic SAN RR interval variability signatures, pointing to a reduction in the kinetics of pacemaker clock mechanisms, leading to reduced synchronization of molecular functions within and among SAN cells. This loss of high-frequency signal processing within intrinsic SAN signatures resulted in a marked increase in the mean intrinsic RR interval. The impact of autonomic signatures on RR interval variability were net sympathetic and partially compensated for the reduced kinetics of the intrinsic SAN RR interval variability signatures, and partially, but not completely, shifted the EKG RR time series intervals to a more youthful pattern. Cross-sectional analyses of other subsets of C57/BL6 ages indicated that at or beyond the median life span of our longitudinal cohort, noncardiac, constitutional, whole-body frailty was increased, energetic efficiency was reduced, and the respiratory exchange ratio increased.

This higher level of oxidative stress also can be exploited to kill tumor cells while leaving normal cells intact. In this study we have found that isovalerylspiramycin I (ISP I), a novel macrolide antibiotic, suppresses cancer cell growth and tumor metastases by targeting the nucleolar protein selenoprotein H (SELH), which plays critical roles in keeping redox homeostasis and genome stability in cancer cells. Methods: We developed ISP I through genetic recombination and tested the antitumor effects using primary and metastatic cancer models. The drug target was identified using the drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) and mass spectrum assays. The effects of ISP I were assessed for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, DNA damage, R-loop formation and its impact on the JNK2/TIF-IA/RNA polymerase I (POLI) transcription pathway. Results: ISP I suppresses cancer cell growth and tumor metastases by targeting SELH. Suppression of SELH induces accumulation of ROS and cancer cell-specific genomic instability. The accumulation of ROS in the nucleolus triggers nucleolar stress and blocks ribosomal RNA transcription via the JNK2/TIF-IA/POLI pathway, causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells. Conclusions: We demonstrated that ISP I links cancer cell vulnerability to oxidative stress and RNA biogenesis by targeting SELH.

We investigated top features, constructed hypothesis-free disease-relevant networks, and investigated drug–gene interactions. We performed automated ML on multimodal data from the Parkinson’s progression marker initiative (PPMI). After selecting the best performing algorithm, all PPMI data was used to tune the selected model. The model was validated in the Parkinson’s Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP) dataset. Our initial model showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 89.72% for the diagnosis of PD. The tuned model was then tested for validation on external data (PDBP, AUC 85.03%). Optimizing thresholds for classification increased the diagnosis prediction accuracy and other metrics. Finally, networks were built to identify gene communities specific to PD. Combining data modalities outperforms the single biomarker paradigm. UPSIT and PRS contributed most to the predictive power of the model, but the accuracy of these are supplemented by many smaller effect transcripts and risk SNPs.

DM is not particularly sensitive to the choice of biomarkers; however, this makes comparison across studies difficult. Here we aimed to identify and validate a standard, optimized version of DM that would be highly stable across populations, while using fewer and more commonly measured biomarkers. Methods: Using three datasets (the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, Invecchiare in Chianti and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), we selected the most stable sets of biomarkers in all three populations, notably when interchanging RPs across populations. We performed regression models, using a fourth dataset (the Women’s Health and Aging Study), to compare the new DM sets to other well-known metrics [allostatic load (AL) and self-assessed health (SAH)] in their association with diverse health outcomes: mortality, frailty, cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, and comorbidity number. Results: A nine- (DM9) and a seventeen-biomarker set (DM17) were identified as highly stable regardless of the chosen RP (e.g.: mean correlation among versions generated by interchanging RPs across dataset of r = 0.94 for both DM9 and DM17). In general, DM17 and DM9 were both competitive compared with AL and SAH in predicting aging correlates, with some exceptions for DM9. For example, DM9, DM17, AL, and SAH all predicted mortality to a similar extent (ranges of hazard ratios of 1.15–1.30, 1.21–1.36, 1.17–1.38, and 1.17–1.49, respectively). On the other hand, DM9 predicted CVD less well than DM17 (ranges of odds ratios of 0.97–1.08, 1.07–1.85, respectively). Conclusions: The metrics we propose here are easy to measure with data that are already available in a wide array of panel, cohort, and clinical studies. The standardized versions here lose a small amount of predictive power compared to more complete versions, but are nonetheless competitive with existing metrics of overall health.

In nature, however, bacteria frequently live in densely packed spatially-structured communities. How does spatial structure affect bacterial cooperative behaviors? In this work, we examine rhamnolipid production—a cooperative and virulent behavior of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here we show that, in striking contrast to well-mixed liquid culture, rhamnolipid gene expression in spatially-structured colonies is strongly associated with colony specific growth rate, and is impacted by perturbation with diffusible quorum signals.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are characterized by the aberrant accumulation of α-Syn intracytoplasmic Lewy body inclusions and dystrophic Lewy neurites resulting in neurodegeneration associated with inflammation. Cell to cell propagation of α-Syn aggregates is implicated in the progression of PD/DLB, and high concentrations of anti-α-Syn antibodies could inhibit/reduce the spreading of this pathological molecule in the brain.

Both models have been widely used in recent years to define essential functions of microglia and have led to high impact studies that have moved the field forward. Methods: Using either Cx3cr1-iDTR mice in combination with Dtx or via the PLX5622 diet to pharmacologically ablate microglia, we compared the two models via MRI and histology to study the general anatomy of the brain and the CSF/ventricular systems. Additionally, we analyzed the cytokine profile in both microglia ablation models. Results: We discovered that the genetic ablation (Cx3cr1-iDTR + Dtx), but not the pharmacological microglia ablation (PLX5622), displays a surprisingly rapid pathological condition in the brain represented by loss of CSF/ventricles without brain parenchymal swelling. This phenotype was observed both in MRI and histological analysis. To our surprise, we discovered that the iDTR allele alone leads to the loss of CSF/ventricles phenotype following diphtheria toxin (Dtx) treatment independent of cre expression. To examine the underlying mechanism for the loss of CSF in the Cx3cr1-iDTR ablation and iDTR models, we additionally investigated the cytokine profile in the Cx3cr1-iDTR + Dtx, iDTR + Dtx and the PLX models. We found increases of multiple cytokines in the Cx3cr1-iDTR + Dtx but not in the pharmacological ablation model nor the iDTR + Dtx mouse brains at the time of CSF loss (3 days after the first Dtx injection). This result suggests that the upregulation of cytokines is not the cause of the loss of CSF, which is supported by our data indicating that brain parenchyma swelling, or edema are not observed in the Cx3cr1-iDTR + Dtx microglia ablation model. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of the KC/CXCR2 pathway (the most upregulated cytokine in the Cx3cr1-iDTR + Dtx model) did not resolve the CSF/ventricular loss phenotype in the genetic microglia ablation model. Instead, both the Cx3cr1-iDTR + Dtx ablation and iDTR + Dtx models showed increased activated IBA1 + cells in the choroid plexus (CP), suggesting that CP-related pathology might be the contributing factor for the observed CSF/ventricular shrinkage phenotype. Conclusions: Our data, for the first time, reveal a robust and global CSF/ventricular space shrinkage pathology in the Cx3cr1-iDTR genetic ablation model caused by iDTR allele, but not in the PLX5622 ablation model, and suggest that this pathology is not due to brain edema formation but to CP related pathology. Given the wide utilization of the iDTR allele and the Cx3cr1-iDTR model, it is crucial to fully characterize this pathology to understand the underlying causal mechanisms. Specifically, caution is needed when utilizing this model to interpret subtle neurologic functional changes that are thought to be mediated by microglia but could, instead, be due to CSF/ventricular loss in the genetic ablation model.",15,Journal,ar,Article,100,11,11,3,50032,NIH,R01 NS091213,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,94,NA,NA,34983562,Choroid plexus | Edema | Genetic Cx3cr1CreER model | Genetic diphtheria toxin receptor ablation model | Microglia | Neuroinflammation,NA

To distinguish these roles, we generated a knockin mouse carrying a mutated Rap1, which was incapable of binding telomeres and did not result in eroded telomeres or a DDR. Primary Rap1 knockin embryonic fibroblasts showed decreased RAP1 expression and re-localization away from telomeres, with an increased cytosolic distribution akin to that observed in human fibroblasts undergoing telomere erosion.

The mean AP-cycle length (APCL) and APCL variability inform on the effectiveness of clock coupling. Endogenous ATP metabolite adenosine binds to adenosine receptors (A1, A3) that couple to Gi protein-coupled receptors, reducing spontaneous AP firing rate via Gβγ signaling that activates IKAch,Ado. Adenosine also inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity via Gαi signaling, impacting cAMP-mediated protein kinase-A-dependent protein phosphorylation. We hypothesize that in addition to IKAch,Ado activation, adenosine impacts also Ca2+ via Gαi signaling and that both effects reduce AP firing rate by reducing the effectiveness of the Ca2+ and membrane clock coupling. To this end, we measured Ca2+ and membrane potential characteristics in enzymatically isolated single rabbit SANC. 10 µM adenosine substantially increased both the mean APCL (on average by 43%, n = 10) and AP beat-to-beat variability from 5.1 ± 1.7% to 7.2 ± 2.0% (n = 10) measured via membrane potential and 5.0 ± 2.2% to 10.6 ± 5.9% (n = 40) measured via Ca2+ (assessed as the coefficient of variability = SD/mean). These effects were mediated by hyperpolarization of the maximum diastolic membrane potential (membrane clock effect) and suppression of diastolic local Ca2+releases (LCRs) (Ca2+-clock effect): as LCR size distributions shifted to smaller values, the time of LCR occurrence during diastolic depolarization (LCR period) became prolonged, and the ensemble LCR signal became reduced. The tight linear relationship of coupling between LCR period to the APCL in the presence of adenosine “drifted” upward and leftward, i.e. for a given LCR period, APCL was prolonged, becoming non-linear indicating clock uncoupling. An extreme case of uncoupling occurred at higher adenosine concentrations (>100 µM): small stochastic LCRs failed to self-organize and synchronize to the membrane clock, thus creating a failed attempt to generate an AP resulting in arrhythmia and cessation of AP firing. Thus, the effects of adenosine to activate Gβγ and IKACh,Ado and to activate Gαi, suppressing adenylyl cyclase activity, both contribute to the adenosine-induced increase in the mean APCL and APCL variability by reducing the fidelity of clock coupling and AP firing rate.",4,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,977807,21100215107,NIH,undefined,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,96,NA,NA,NA,adenosine | calcium release | cardiac arrhythmia | coupled-clock pacemaker system | sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) | sick sinus syndrome | sinoatrial node (SAN) | sinus node arrest,NA

An important step to developing new treatments is better trial methodology. Disease mechanisms in SVD differ from other stroke etiologies; therefore, treatments need to be evaluated in cohorts in which SVD has been well characterized. Furthermore, SVD itself can be caused by a number of different pathologies, the most common of which are arteriosclerosis and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. To date, there have been few sufficiently powered high-quality randomized clinical trials in SVD, and inconsistent trial methodology has made interpretation of some findings difficult. Observations: To address these issues and develop guidelines for optimizing design of clinical trials in SVD, the Framework for Clinical Trials in Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (FINESSE) was created under the auspices of the International Society of Vascular Behavioral and Cognitive Disorders. Experts in relevant aspects of SVD trial methodology were convened, and a structured Delphi consensus process was used to develop recommendations. Areas in which recommendations were developed included optimal choice of study populations, choice of clinical end points, use of brain imaging as a surrogate outcome measure, use of circulating biomarkers for participant selection and as surrogate markers, novel trial designs, and prioritization of therapeutic agents using genetic data via Mendelian randomization. Conclusions and Relevance: The FINESSE provides recommendations for trial design in SVD for which there are currently few effective treatments. However, new insights into understanding disease pathogenesis, particularly from recent genetic studies, provide novel pathways that could be therapeutically targeted. In addition, whether other currently available cardiovascular interventions are specifically effective in SVD, as opposed to other subtypes of stroke, remains uncertain.

It has been known for decades that the skeleton contains most (>85%) of the body’s citrate, but the question of why and how this metabolite should be partitioned in bone has received singularly little attention. Here, we show that osteoblasts use a specialized metabolic pathway to regulate uptake, endogenous production, and the deposition of citrate into bone. Osteoblasts express high levels of the membranous Na+-dependent citrate transporter solute carrier family 13 member 5 (Slc13a5) gene. Inhibition or genetic disruption of Slc13a5 reduced osteogenic citrate uptake and disrupted mineral nodule formation. Bones from mice lacking Slc13a5 globally, or selectively in osteoblasts, showed equivalent reductions in cortical thickness, with similarly compromised mechanical strength. Surprisingly, citrate content in mineral from Slc13a52/2 osteoblasts was increased fourfold relative to controls, suggesting the engagement of compensatory mechanisms to augment endogenous citrate production. Indeed, through the coordinated functioning of the apical membrane citrate transporter SLC13A5 and a mitochondrial zinc transporter protein (ZIP1; encoded by Slc39a1), a mediator of citrate efflux from the tricarboxylic acid cycle, SLC13A5 mediates citrate entry from blood and its activity exerts homeostatic control of cytoplasmic citrate. Intriguingly, Slc13a5-deficient mice also exhibited defective tooth enamel and dentin formation, a clinical feature, which we show is recapitulated in primary teeth from children with SLC13A5 mutations.

On the basis of internal cross-ancestry validation and an independent follow-up in 89,084 additional cases of stroke (30% non-European) and 1,013,843 control individuals, 87% of the primary stroke risk loci and 60% of the secondary stroke risk loci were replicated (P < 0.05).

Many of the protein-protein interactions involving NQO1 have been shown to be regulated by the pyridine nucleotide redox balance. NQO1 can modify its conformation as a result of redox changes in pyridine nucleotides and sites on the C-terminal and helix seven regions of NQO1 have been identified as potential areas that may be involved in redox-dependent protein-protein interactions. Since post-translational modifications can modify the functionality of proteins, we examined whether redox-dependent conformational changes induced in NQO1 would alter lysine acetylation. Recombinant NQO1 was incubated with and without NADH then acetylated non-enzymatically by acetic anhydride or S-acetylglutathione (Ac-GSH). NQO1 acetylation was determined by immunoblot and site-specific lysine acetylation was quantified by mass spectrometry (MS). NQO1 was readily acetylated by acetic anhydride and Ac-GSH. Interestingly, despite a large number of lysine residues (9%) in NQO1 only a small subset of lysines were acetylated and the majority of these were located in or near the functional C-terminal or helix seven regions. Reduction of NQO1 by NADH prior to acetylation resulted in almost complete protection of NQO1 from lysine acetylation as confirmed by immunoblot analysis and MS. Lysines located within the redox-active C-terminus and helix seven regions were readily acetylated when NQO1 was in an oxidized conformation but were protected from acetylation when NQO1 was in the reduced conformation. To investigate regulatory mechanisms of enzymatic deacetylation, NQO1 was acetylated by Ac-GSH then exposed to purified sirtuins (SIRT 1-3) or histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). NQO1 could be deacetylated by all sirtuin isoforms and quantitative MS analysis performed using SIRT2 revealed very robust deacetylation of NQO1, specifically at K262 and K271 in the C-terminal region. No deacetylation of NQO1 by HDAC6 was detected. These data demonstrate that the same subset of key lysine residues in the C-terminal and helix seven regions of NQO1 undergo redox dependent acetylation and are regulated by sirtuin-mediated deacetylation.",3,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,1015642,21100214102,NIH,R01-DK109964-04,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,104,NA,NA,NA,acetylation | glutathione | NADH | NQO1 | redox proteomics | SIRT2 | SIRTUIN,NA

In this work, we develop and evaluate three methods for modelling the longitudinal course of amyloid accumulation in three cohorts using amyloid PET imaging. We then use these novel approaches to investigate factors that influence the timing of amyloid onset and the timing from amyloid onset to impairment onset in the Alzheimer's disease continuum. Data were acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP). Amyloid PET was used to assess global amyloid burden. Three methods were evaluated for modelling amyloid accumulation using 10-fold cross-validation and holdout validation where applicable. Estimated amyloid onset age was compared across all three modelling methods and cohorts. Cox regression and accelerated failure time models were used to investigate whether sex, apolipoprotein E genotype and e4 carriage were associated with amyloid onset age in all cohorts. Cox regression was used to investigate whether apolipoprotein E (e4 carriage and e3e3, e3e4, e4e4 genotypes), sex or age of amyloid onset were associated with the time from amyloid onset to impairment onset (global clinical dementia rating ≥1) in a subset of 595 ADNI participants that were not impaired before amyloid onset. Model prediction and estimated amyloid onset age were similar across all three amyloid modelling methods. Sex and apolipoprotein E e4 carriage were not associated with PET-measured amyloid accumulation rates. Apolipoprotein E genotype and e4 carriage, but not sex, were associated with amyloid onset age such that e4 carriers became amyloid positive at an earlier age compared to non-carriers, and greater e4 dosage was associated with an earlier amyloid onset age. In the ADNI, e4 carriage, being female and a later amyloid onset age were all associated with a shorter time from amyloid onset to impairment onset. The risk of impairment onset due to age of amyloid onset was non-linear and accelerated for amyloid onset age >65. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of modelling longitudinal amyloid accumulation to enable individualized estimates of amyloid onset age from amyloid PET imaging.

Results from animal and cellular models suggest that FAD-deficient forms of NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) may accelerate the aggregation of Alzheimer's amyloid-β peptide (Aβ1-42). Here, we examined in vitro whether NQO1 and its FAD-deficient P187S mutation (NQO1*2) directly interact with Aβ1-42 and modify its rate of aggregation. When monitored using the fluorescence of either noncovalent thioflavin T (ThT) or HiLyte Fluor 647 (HF647) dye covalently attached to the Aβ1-42 peptide, the aggregation kinetics of Aβ1-42 were markedly more rapid in the presence of NQO1*2 than the wild-type (WT) NQO1. Experiments using apo-NQO1 indicate that this increase is linked to the inability of NQO1*2 to bind to FAD. Furthermore, dicoumarol, an NQO1 inhibitor that binds near the FAD-binding site and stabilizes NQO1*2, markedly decreased the aggregation kinetics of Aβ1-42. Imaging flow cytometry confirmed in-vitro coaggregation of NQO1 isoforms and Aβ1-42. Aβ1-42 alone forms rod-shaped fibril structures while in the presence of NQO1 isoforms, Aβ1-42 is incorporated in the middle of larger globular protein aggregates surrounded by NQO1 molecules. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis indicates that Aβ1-42 interacts with NQO1 isoforms with a specific stoichiometry through a hydrophobic interaction with positive enthalpy and entropy changes.

We conducted a single-arm clinical trial to investigate the effects of once daily administration of oral empagliflozin (25 mg) for 14 days on systemic and brain metabolism in 21 non-diabetics aged 55 years old or older.

Participants with PAD included those with and without PAD progression. METHODS AND RESULTS: mRNA and miRNA sequencing were performed to identify differentially expressed genes, differentially expressed miRNAs, mRNA-miRNA interactions, and associated biological pathways for 3 sets of comparisons: (1) PAD progression (n=7) versus non-PAD (n=7); (2) PAD no progression (n=6) versus non-PAD; and (3) PAD progression versus PAD no progression. Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine gastrocnemius muscle fiber types and muscle fiber size. Differentially expressed genes and differentially expressed miRNAs were more abundant in the comparison of PAD progression versus non-PAD compared with PAD with versus without progression. Among the top significant cellular pathways in subjects with PAD progression were muscle contraction or development, transforming growth factor-beta, growth/differentia-tion factor, and activin signaling, inflammation, cellular senescence, and notch signaling. Subjects with PAD progression had increased frequency of smaller Type 2a gastrocnemius muscle fibers in exploratory analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Humans with PAD progression exhibited greater differences in the number of gene and miRNA expression, biological pathways, and Type 2a muscle fiber size compared with those without PAD. Fewer differences were observed between people with PAD without progression and control patients without PAD. Further study is needed to confirm whether the identified transcripts may serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and progression of PAD.",7,Journal,ar,Article,100,17,17,e023085,21100246515,NIH,AG047510,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,114,NA,NA,36300658,differentially expressed genes (DEG) | gastrocnemius muscle | peripheral artery disease (PAD),NA

Recently, we have discovered that damaged lysosomes form and sort tubules into moving vesicles. We named this process LYTL for LYsosomal Tubulation/sorting driven by LRRK2, as the Parkinson’s disease protein LRRK2 promotes tubulation by recruiting the motor adaptor protein JIP4 to lysosomes via phosphorylated RAB proteins. Here we use spinning-disk microscopy combined with superresolution to further characterize LYTL after membrane damage with LLOMe (l-leucyl-l-leucine methyl ester). We identified the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) colocalizing with sites of fission of lysosome-derived tubules. In addition, modifying the morphology of the ER by reducing ER tubules leads to a decrease in LYTL sorting, suggesting that contact with tubular ER is necessary for lysosomal membrane sorting.

In this study, we conducted a systematic review of the literature and an individual participant data analysis of multiple prospective cohorts to investigate the association between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and incident diabetes. Methods: We performed a systematic review of the literature in Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to February 11, 2022. A two-stage individual participant data analysis was conducted to compare participants with subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism vs euthyroidism at baseline and the adjusted risk of developing diabetes at follow-up. Results: Among 61 178 adults from 18 studies, 49% were females, mean age was 58 years, and mean follow-up time was 8.2 years. At the last available follow-up, there was no association between subclinical hypothyroidism and incidence of diabetes (odds ratio (OR) = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.88-1.17, I2 = 0%) or subclinical hyperthyroidism and incidence of diabetes (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.82-1.30, I2 = 0%), in age- and sex-adjusted analyses. Time-to-event analysis showed similar results (hazard ratio for subclinical hypothyroidism: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.87-1.11; hazard ratio for subclinical hyperthyroidism: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.88-1.29).

We aimed to investigate these aspects and the underlying molecular mechanisms with short-term unloading and active recovery (AR). Eleven healthy males underwent a 10-day unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS) period, followed by 21-day AR based on resistance exercise. Quadriceps femoris (QF) cross-sectional area (CSA) and isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) were evaluated. Intramuscular electromyographic recordings were obtained during 10% and 25% MVC isometric contractions from the vastus lateralis (VL). Biomarkers of NMJ molecular instability (serum c-terminal agrin fragment, CAF), axonal damage (neurofilament light chain) and denervation status were assessed from blood samples and VL biopsies. NMJ and ion channel transcriptomic profiles were investigated by RNA-sequencing. QF CSA and MVC decreased with ULLS. Increased CAF and altered NMJ transcriptome with unloading suggested the emergence of NMJ molecular instability, which was not associated with impaired NMJ transmission stability. Instead, increased MUP complexity and decreased motor unit firing rates were found after ULLS. Downregulation of ion channel gene expression was found together with increased neurofilament light chain concentration and partial denervation. The AR period restored most of these neuromuscular alterations. In conclusion, the human NMJ is destabilized at the molecular level but shows functional resilience to a 10-day unloading period at least at relatively low contraction intensities. However, MUP properties are altered by ULLS, possibly due to alterations in ion channel dynamics and initial axonal damage and denervation. These changes are fully reversed by 21 days of AR. (Figure presented.). Key points: We used integrative electrophysiological and molecular approaches to comprehensively investigate changes in neuromuscular integrity and function after a 10-day unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS), followed by 21 days of active recovery in young healthy men, with a particular focus on neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and motor unit potential (MUP) properties alterations. After 10-day ULLS, we found significant NMJ molecular alterations in the absence of NMJ transmission stability impairment. These findings suggest that the human NMJ is functionally resilient against insults and stresses induced by short-term disuse at least at relatively low contraction intensities, at which low-threshold, slow-type motor units are recruited. Intramuscular electromyography analysis revealed that unloading caused increased MUP complexity and decreased motor unit firing rates, and these alterations could be related to the observed changes in skeletal muscle ion channel pool and initial and partial signs of fibre denervation and axonal damage. The active recovery period restored these neuromuscular changes.",35,Journal,ar,Article,100,15,15,NA,23478,UNIPD,DC‐VUM‐2017‐006,Università degli Studi di Padova,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,118,00223751,4731-4751,36071599,C-terminal agrin fragment | disuse | intramuscular electromyography | jiggle | jitter | motor units,NA

In contrast to the well-studied eicosanoids, there is a lack of analytical methods for octadecanoids, hampering further investigations in the field. We developed an integrated workflow combining chiral separation by supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) and reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry detection for quantification of a broad panel of octadecanoids. The platform includes 70 custom-synthesized analytical and internal standards to extend the coverage of the octadecanoid synthetic pathways. A total of 103 octadecanoids could be separated by chiral SFC and complex enantioseparations could be performed in <13 min, while the achiral LC method separated 67 octadecanoids in 13.5 min. The LC method provided a robust complementary approach with greater sensitivity relative to the SFC method. Both methods were validated in solvent and surrogate matrix in terms of linearity, lower limits of quantification (LLOQ), recovery, accuracy, precision, and matrix effects. Instrumental linearity was good for both methods (R2> 0.995) and LLOQ ranged from 0.03 to 6.00 ng/mL for SFC and 0.01 to 1.25 ng/mL for LC. The average accuracy in the solvent and surrogate matrix ranged from 89 to 109% in SFC and from 106 to 220% in LC, whereas coefficients of variation (CV) were <14% (at medium and high concentrations) and 26% (at low concentrations).

Previous data have demonstrated that recruitment to various membranes of the endolysosomal system results in LRRK2 activation. However, the mechanism(s) underlying LRRK2 activation at endolysosomal membranes and the cellular consequences of these events are still poorly understood. Here, we directed LRRK2 to lysosomes and early endosomes, triggering both LRRK2 autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of the direct LRRK2 substrates Rab10 and Rab12. However, when directed to the lysosomal membrane, pRab10 was restricted to perinuclear lysosomes, whereas pRab12 was visualized on both peripheral and perinuclear LRRK2+ lysosomes, suggesting that lysosomal positioning provides additional regulation of LRRK2-dependent Rab phosphorylation. Anterograde transport of lysosomes to the cell periphery by increasing the expression of ARL8B and SKIP or by knockdown of JIP4 blocked the recruitment and phosphorylation of Rab10 by LRRK2. The absence of pRab10 from the lysosomal membrane prevented the formation of a lysosomal tubulation and sorting process we previously named LYTL. Conversely, overexpression of RILP resulted in lysosomal clustering within the perinuclear area and increased LRRK2-dependent Rab10 recruitment and phosphorylation. The regulation of Rab10 phosphorylation in the perinuclear area depends on counteracting phosphatases, as the knockdown of phosphatase PPM1H significantly increased pRab10 signal and lysosomal tubulation in the perinuclear region. Our findings suggest that LRRK2 can be activated at multiple cellular membranes, including lysosomes, and that lysosomal positioning further provides the regulation of some Rab substrates likely via differential phosphatase activity or effector protein presence in nearby cellular compartments.",24,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,e2205492119,21121,NIA,undefined,National Institute on Aging,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,132,00278424,NA,36256825,JIP4 | kinase | LLOMe | LYTL | Parkinson’s disease,NA

Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) is regularly employed for body composition studies, especially for the structural and material properties of the bone. Furthermore, pQCT acquisition requires low radiation dose and the scanner is compact and portable. However, pQCT scans have limited spatial resolution and moderate SNR. pQCT image quality is frequently degraded by involuntary subject movement during image acquisition. These limitations may often compromise the accuracy of tissue quantification, and emphasize the need for automated and robust quantification methods. We propose a tissue identification and quantification methodology that addresses image quality limitations and artifacts, with increased interest in subject movement. We introduce a multi-atlas image segmentation (MAIS) framework for semantic segmentation of hard and soft tissues in pQCT scans at multiple levels of the lower leg. We describe the stages of statistical atlas generation, deformable registration and multi-tissue classifier fusion. We evaluated the performance of our methodology using multiple deformable registration approaches against reference tissue masks. We also evaluated the performance of conventional model-based segmentation against the same reference data to facilitate comparisons. We studied the effect of subject movement on tissue segmentation quality. We also applied the top performing method to a larger out-of-sample dataset and report the quantification results. The results show that multi-atlas image segmentation with diffeomorphic deformation and probabilistic label fusion produces very good quality over all tissues, even for scans with significant quality degradation. The application of our technique to the larger dataset reveals trends of age-related body composition changes that are consistent with the literature.

However, identification of changes in the CP remains poorly characterized in obesity, one of the main risk factors of neurodegeneration, including in the absence of frank central nervous system alterations. Our goal here was to characterize the association between obesity, measured by the body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference (WC) metrics, and CP microstructure and volume, assessed using advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methodology. This cross-sectional study was performed in the clinical unit of the National Institute on Aging and included a participant population of 123 cognitively unimpaired individuals spanning the age range of 22 – 94 years. Automated segmentation methods from FreeSurfer were used to identify the CP structure. Our analysis included volumetric measurements, quantitative relaxometry measures (T1 and T2), and the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measure of mean diffusivity (MD). Strong positive associations were observed between WC and all MRI metrics, as well as CP volume. When comparing groups based on the established cutoff point by the National Institutes of Health for WC, a modest difference in MD and a significant difference in T1 values were observed between obese and lean individuals. We also found differences in T1 and MD between obese and overweight individuals as defined using the BMI cutoff. We conjecture that these observations in CP volume and microstructure are due to obesity-induced inflammation, diet, or, very likely, dysregulations in leptin binding and transport.

Furthermore, anti-IL-35 blockade or genetic ablation of IL-35 in B cells also reduces tumour growth. Unexpectedly, the STING–IL-35 axis in B cells reduces proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells and attenuates the NK-driven anti-tumour response.

The resulting data can be used to quantify 24-h activity profiles, known as circadian rest-activity rhythms (CRARs). Actigraphic CRARs have been tied to cognitive performance and decline in older adults; however, little is known about links between CRARs and performance or change in specific cognitive domains, or how individual differences may influence these associations. We investigated associations of actigraphic CRARs with cognitive performance and change in middle-aged and older adults, and explored whether age, sex/gender, race, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 carrier status moderated these associations. Materials and methods: Participants (N = 422; 47% male) were cognitively healthy adults (i.e., without mild cognitive impairment or dementia) at baseline aged ≥ 50 years from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging who completed 5.6 ± 0.89 nights of wrist actigraphy and tests of memory, executive function, attention, language, and visuospatial ability at the same visit the actigraph was issued; 292 participants had repeat cognitive testing 3.12 (1.58) years later. Predictors included indices of rhythm strength [i.e., amplitude; relative amplitude (RA); interdaily stability (IS); mesor], delayed timing of the rhythm peak [i.e., later acrophase; midpoint of an individual’s least active 5 h (L5 time); midpoint of an individual’s most active 10 h (M10 time)], and fragmentation [i.e., intradaily variability (IV)]. Results: In main effects, later L5 time was cross sectionally associated with poorer memory, and greater IS predicted slower longitudinal memory decline. Associations of CRARs with cognition differed as a function of age, sex/gender, race, and APOE e4 carrier status. Conclusion: Among middle-aged and older adults, delayed circadian phase is associated with poorer memory performance, and greater day-to-day rhythm stability is associated with slower declines in memory.

However, a few FUS-mutated cases with a very late disease onset and slow progression have been reported. To analyze genotype-phenotype correlations and identify the prognostic factors in FUS-ALS cases. Methods We identified and cross-sectionally analyzed 22 FUS-ALS patient histories from a single-center cohort of 2,615 genetically tested patients and reviewed 289 previously published FUS-ALS cases. Survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier survival curves, followed by the log-rank test and multivariate Cox analysis. Results Survival of FUS-ALS is age-dependent: In our cohort, early-onset cases had a rapid disease progression and short survival (p = 0.000003) while the outcome of FUS-mutated patients with mid-to-late onset did not differ from non–FUS-ALS patients (p = 0.437). Meta-analysis of literature data confirmed this trend (p = 0.00003). This survival pattern is not observed in other ALS-related genes in our series. We clustered FUS-ALS patients in 3 phenotypes: (1) axial ALS, with upper cervical and dropped-head onset in mid-to-late adulthood; (2) benign ALS, usually with a late-onset and slow disease progression; and (3) juvenile ALS, often with bulbar onset and preceded by learning disability or mild mental retardation. Those phenotypes arise from different mutations. Discussion We observed specific genotype-phenotype correlations of FUS-ALS and identified age at onset as the most critical prognostic factor.

Telmisartan (an angiotensin receptor blocker) has properties that reverse these abnormalities. Objective: To determine whether telmisartan improves 6-minute walk distance, compared with placebo, in patients with lower extremity PAD at 6-month follow-up. Design, Setting, and Participants: Double-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted at 2 US sites and involving 114 participants. Enrollment occurred between December 28, 2015, and November 9, 2021. Final follow-up occurred on May 6, 2022. Interventions: The trial randomized patients using a 2 × 2 factorial design to compare the effects of telmisartan plus supervised exercise vs telmisartan alone and supervised exercise alone and to compare telmisartan alone vs placebo. Participants with PAD were randomized to 1 of 4 groups: Telmisartan plus exercise (n = 30), telmisartan plus attention control (n = 29), placebo plus exercise (n = 28), or placebo plus attention control (n = 27) for 6 months. The originally planned sample size was 240 participants. Due to slower than anticipated enrollment, the primary comparison was changed to the 2 combined telmisartan groups vs the 2 combined placebo groups and the target sample size was changed to 112 participants. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the 6-month change in 6-minute walk distance (minimum clinically important difference, 8-20 m). The secondary outcomes were maximal treadmill walking distance; Walking Impairment Questionnaire scores for distance, speed, and stair climbing; and the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey physical functioning score. The results were adjusted for study site, baseline 6-minute walk distance, randomization to exercise vs attention control, sex, and history of heart failure at baseline. Results: Of the 114 randomized patients (mean age, 67.3 [SD, 9.9] years; 46 were women [40.4%]; and 81 were Black individuals [71.1%]), 105 (92%) completed 6-month follow-up. At 6-month follow-up, telmisartan did not significantly improve 6-minute walk distance (from a mean of 341.6 m to 343.0 m; within-group change: 1.32 m) compared with placebo (from a mean of 352.3 m to 364.8 m; within-group change: 12.5 m) and the adjusted between-group difference was-16.8 m (95% CI,-35.9 m to 2.2 m; P =.08). Compared with placebo, telmisartan did not significantly improve any of the 5 secondary outcomes. The most common serious adverse event was hospitalization for PAD (ie, lower extremity revascularization, amputation, or gangrene). Three participants (5.1%) in the telmisartan group and 2 participants (3.6%) in the placebo group were hospitalized for PAD. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with PAD, telmisartan did not improve 6-minute walk distance at 6-month follow-up compared with placebo. These results do not support telmisartan for improving walking performance in patients with PAD.

The most significant evidence lies in the GBA gene, which encodes for the lysosomal enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase (β-GCase), considered the main genetic risk factor for sporadic PD. The loss of β-GCase activity results in the formation of α-synuclein deposits. The present study was aimed to determine the activity of the main lysosomal enzymes and the cofactors Prosaposin (PSAP) and Saposin C in PD and healthy controls, and their contribution to α-synuclein (α-Syn) aggregation. 42 PD patients and 37 age-matched healthy controls were included in the study. We first analyzed the β-GCase, β-galactosidase (β-gal), β-hexosaminidase (Hex B) and Cathepsin D (CatD) activities in white blood cells. We also measured the GBA, β-GAL, β-HEX, CTSD, PSAP, Saposin C and α-Syn protein levels by Western-blot. We found a 20% reduced β-GCase and β-gal activities in PD patients compared to controls. PSAP and Saposin C protein levels were significantly lower in PD patients and correlated with increased levels of α-synuclein. CatD, in contrast, showed significantly increased activity and protein levels in PD patients compared to controls. Increased CTSD protein levels in PD patients correlated, intriguingly, with a higher concentration of α-Syn. Our findings suggest that lysosomal dysfunction in sporadic PD is due, at least in part, to an alteration in Saposin C derived from reduced PSAP levels. That would lead to a significant decrease in the β-GCase activity, resulting in the accumulation of α-syn.

However, the physiological underpinnings of gait and brain health have not been well explored. We examined the associations of the energetic cost of walking with brain volume in cognitively unimpaired adults from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Methods: We used brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 850 participants (mean baseline age 66.3 ± 14.5 years), of whom 451 had longitudinal MRI data (2.8 ± 1.0 MRI scans over 4.0 ± 2.0 years). The energetic cost of walking was assessed as the average energy expended (VO2) during 2.5 minutes of customary-paced overground walking. Multivariable linear mixed-effects models examined the associations between baseline energetic cost of walking and regional brain volumes adjusting for covariates. Results: At baseline, higher energetic cost of walking was cross-sectionally associated with lower gray and white matter volumes within the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, as well as hippocampal, total brain, and larger ventricular volumes (all false-discovery rate [FDR] p < .05). A baseline energetic cost of walking × time interaction demonstrated that participants with higher energetic cost of walking had faster annual decline in hippocampal volume (FDR p = .02) and accelerated annual increase in ventricular volumes (FDR p = .02).

Hearing impairment is related to poor mobility, and we hypothesize that such relationships would be stronger in persons with compromised sensorimotor function than those with preserved sensorimotor function. Methods: We analyzed 601 cognitively normal (Mini-Mental State Examination ≥24 or free of cognitive impairment/dementia) Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants aged 50 or older with concurrent data on hearing (better ear pure-tone average [PTA]), mobility (6 m usual gait, 400 m endurance walk), and neuropsychological function including attention via Trail Making Test (TMT)-A, executive function via the difference between TMT-A and B, and Digit Symbol Substitution Test, and manual dexterity via Pegboard performance. We examined the association of PTA, each cognitive measure, and their interaction with mobility using multivariable linear regression, adjusted for covariates. Results: After covariate adjustment, there were significant interactions between PTA and all cognitive measures in the association with 400 m endurance walking speed as the outcome. There was also a significant interaction between PTA and pegboard nondominant hand performance in the association with 6 m gait as the outcome. In all these cases, the PTA–mobility relationship was stronger among participants with lower cognition. Conclusion: Impaired hearing more strongly relates to poor mobility among those with compromised neuropsychological performance, especially manual dexterity reflecting the motor–cognitive interface and sensorimotor function, than those with preserved neuropsychological performance.

Our previous work has described the SAN as composed of a hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel 4 (HCN4)-expressing pacemaker cell meshwork, which merges with a network of connexin 43+/F-actin+ cells. It is also known that sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation create an autonomic plexus in the SAN that modulates heart rate and rhythm. However, the anatomical details of the interaction of this plexus with the pacemaker cell meshwork have yet to be described. Objectives: This study sought to describe the 3-dimensional cytoarchitecture of the mouse SAN, including autonomic innervation, peripheral glial cells, and pacemaker cells. Methods: The cytoarchitecture of SAN whole-mount preparations was examined by three-dimensional confocal laser-scanning microscopy of triple immunolabeled with combinations of antibodies for HCN4, S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), choline acetyltransferase, or vesicular acetylcholine transporter, and tyrosine hydroxylase, and transmission electron microscopy. Results: The SAN exhibited heterogeneous autonomic innervation, which was accompanied by a web of peripheral glial cells and a novel S100B+/GFAP– interstitial cell population, with a unique morphology and a distinct distribution pattern, creating complex interactions with other cell types in the node, particularly with HCN4-expressing cells. Transmission electron microscopy identified a similar population of interstitial cells as telocytes, which appeared to secrete vesicles toward pacemaker cells. Application of S100B to SAN preparations desynchronized Ca2+ signaling in HCN4-expressing cells and increased variability in SAN impulse rate and rhythm. Conclusions: The autonomic plexus, peripheral glial cell web, and a novel S100B+/GFAP– interstitial cell type embedded within the HCN4+ cell meshwork increase the structural and functional complexity of the SAN and provide a new regulatory pathway of rhythmogenesis.",17,Journal,ar,Article,100,11,11,NA,21100415950,NIH,ZIAAG000299,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,148,2405500X,1191-1215,36182566,brain-like cytoarchitecture and function | calcium signaling | HCN4 cells | interstitial cells | intrinsic cardiac ganglion | pacemaker | peripheral glial cells | rhythm | S100B | sinoatrial node | telocytes,S2405500X22005746

Accelerometry and advanced statistical methods may enable us to quantify performance fatigability more granularly via objective detection of performance decline. Thus, we developed the Pittsburgh Performance Fatigability Index (PPFI) using triaxial raw accelerations from wrist-worn accelerometer from two in-laboratory 400-m walks. Methods Sixty-three older adults from our cross-sectional study (mean age, 78 yr; 56% women; 88% White) completed fast-paced (n = 59) and/or usual-paced 400-m walks (n = 56) with valid accelerometer data. Participants wore ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers (The ActiGraph LLC, Pensacola, FL) on nondominant wrist during the walking task. Triaxial raw accelerations from accelerometers were used to compute PPFI, which quantifies percentage of area under the observed gait cadence-versus-time trajectory during a 400-m walk to a hypothetical area that would be produced if the participant sustained maximal cadence throughout the entire walk. Results Higher PPFI scores (higher score = greater fatigability) correlated with worse physical function, slower chair stands speed and gait speed, worse cardiorespiratory fitness and mobility, and lower leg peak power (|ρ| = 0.36-0.61 from fast-paced and |ρ| = 0.28-0.67 from usual-paced walks, all P < 0.05). PPFI scores from both walks remained associated with chair stands speed, gait speed, fitness, and mobility, after adjustment for sex, age, race, weight, height, and smoking status; PPFI scores from the fast-paced walk were associated with leg peak power.

Nevertheless, racemic ketamine and (S)-ketamine are controlled substances with known abuse potential and their use is associated with undesirable side effects. For these reasons, research efforts have focused on identifying alternatives. One candidate is (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine ((2R,6R)-HNK), a ketamine metabolite that in preclinical models lacks the dissociative and abuse properties of ketamine while retaining its antidepressant-like behavioral efficacy. (2R,6R)-HNK’s mechanism of action however is unclear. The main goals of this study were to perform an in-depth pharmacological characterization of (2R,6R)-HNK at known ketamine targets, to use target deconvolution approaches to discover novel proteins that bind to (2R,6R)-HNK, and to characterize the biodistribution and behavioral effects of (2R,6R)-HNK across several procedures related to substance use disorder liability. We found that unlike (S)- or (R)-ketamine, (2R,6R)-HNK did not directly bind to any known or proposed ketamine targets. Extensive screening and target deconvolution experiments at thousands of human proteins did not identify any other direct (2R,6R)-HNK-protein interactions. Biodistribution studies using radiolabeled (2R,6R)-HNK revealed non-selective brain regional enrichment, and no specific binding in any organ other than the liver. (2R,6R)-HNK was inactive in conditioned place preference, open-field locomotor activity, and intravenous self-administration procedures. Despite these negative findings, (2R,6R)-HNK produced a reduction in immobility time in the forced swim test and a small but significant increase in metabolic activity across a network of brain regions, and this metabolic signature differed from the brain metabolic profile induced by ketamine enantiomers. In sum, our results indicate that (2R,6R)-HNK does not share pharmacological or behavioral profile similarities with ketamine or its enantiomers. However, it could still be possible that both ketamine and (2R,6R)-HNK exert antidepressant-like efficacy through a common and previously unidentified mechanism. Given its pharmacological profile, we predict that (2R,6R)-HNK will exhibit a favorable safety profile in clinical trials, and we must wait for clinical studies to determine its antidepressant efficacy.",25,Journal,ar,Article,100,14,14,NA,17382,NIH,R01-MH107615,National Institutes of Health,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,158,13594184,4144-4156,35768639,NA,NA

The resource comprises 2,138,428 participants with a follow-up of approximately 20 million person-years and 116,117 documented incident major osteoporotic fractures. Introduction: The availability of the fracture risk assessment tool FRAX® has substantially enhanced the targeting of treatment to those at high risk of fracture with FRAX now incorporated into more than 100 clinical osteoporosis guidelines worldwide. The aim of this study is to determine whether the current algorithms can be further optimised with respect to current and novel risk factors. Methods: A computerised literature search was performed in PubMed from inception until May 17, 2019, to identify eligible cohorts for updating the FRAX coefficients. Additionally, we searched the abstracts of conference proceedings of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, European Calcified Tissue Society and World Congress of Osteoporosis. Prospective cohort studies with data on baseline clinical risk factors and incident fractures were eligible. Results: Of the 836 records retrieved, 53 were selected for full-text assessment after screening on title and abstract. Twelve cohorts were deemed eligible and of these, 4 novel cohorts were identified. These cohorts, together with 60 previously identified cohorts, will provide the resource for constructing an updated version of FRAX comprising 2,138,428 participants with a follow-up of approximately 20 million person-years and 116,117 documented incident major osteoporotic fractures. For each known and candidate risk factor, multivariate hazard functions for hip fracture, major osteoporotic fracture and death will be tested using extended Poisson regression. Sex- and/or ethnicity-specific differences in the weights of the risk factors will be investigated. After meta-analyses of the cohort-specific beta coefficients for each risk factor, models comprising 10-year probability of hip and major osteoporotic fracture, with or without femoral neck bone mineral density, will be computed.

We therefore aimed to assess the association between multidimensional frailty, determined by Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI), with mortality and good QoL expectancy (GQoLE) in a large representative sample of older adults, over 10 years of follow-up. Methods: In the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, using the data from 2004–2005 and 2014–2015, MPI was calculated using a weighted score of domains of comprehensive geriatric assessment, i.e., number of difficulties in activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL, depressive symptoms, number of medical conditions, body mass index, physical activity level, and social aspects. Mortality was assessed using administrative data, GQoLE indicators were used for longitudinal changes in QoL. Results: 6244 Participants (mean age 71.8 years, 44.5% males) were followed up for 10 years.

Drug treatments for diabetes, such as metformin, could be used as novel treatments for these neurological conditions. Using electronic health records from the USA (OPTUM EHR) we aimed to assess the association of metformin with all-cause dementia, dementia subtypes and PD compared with sulfonylureas. Research design and methods A new user comparator study design was conducted in patients ≥50 years old with diabetes who were new users of metformin or sulfonylureas between 2006 and 2018. Primary outcomes were all-cause dementia and PD. Secondary outcomes were Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Cox proportional hazards models with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were used to estimate the HRs. Subanalyses included stratification by age, race, renal function, and glycemic control. Results We identified 96 140 and 16 451 new users of metformin and sulfonylureas, respectively. Mean age was 66.4±8.2 years (48% male, 83% Caucasian). Over the 5-year follow-up, 3207 patients developed all-cause dementia (2256 (2.3%) metformin, 951 (5.8%) sulfonylurea users) and 760 patients developed PD (625 (0.7%) metformin, 135 (0.8%) sulfonylurea users). After IPTW, HRs for all-cause dementia and PD were 0.80 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.88) and 1.00 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.28). HRs for AD, VD and MCI were 0.81 (0.70-0.94), 0.79 (0.63-1.00) and 0.91 (0.79-1.04). Stronger associations were observed in patients who were younger (<75 years old), Caucasian, and with moderate renal function. Conclusions Metformin users compared with sulfonylurea users were associated with a lower risk of all-cause dementia, AD and VD but not with PD or MCI. Age and renal function modified risk reduction.

Brain tissue maintenance is an energy-demanding process, making it particularly sensitive to hypoperfusion. However, little is known about the association between blood flow and brain microstructural integrity, including in normative aging. Objective: To assess associations between CBF and changes in cerebral tissue integrity in white matter and gray matter brain regions. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this longitudinal cohort study, magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 732 healthy adults from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a prospective longitudinal study (baseline age of 18-30 years) that examined participants up to 8 times during 30 years (1985-1986 to 2015-2016). Cerebral blood flow was measured at baseline (year 25 of the CARDIA study), and changes in diffusion tensor indices of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), measures of microstructural tissue integrity, were measured at both baseline and after approximately 5 years of follow-up (year 30). Analyses were conducted from November 5, 2020, to January 29, 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: Automated algorithms and linear mixed-effects statistical models were used to evaluate the associations between CBF at baseline and changes in FA or MD. Results: After exclusion of participants with missing or low-quality data, 654 at baseline (342 women; mean [SD] age, 50.3 [3.5] years) and 433 at follow-up (230 women; mean [SD] age, 55.1 [3.5] years) were scanned for CBF or FA and MD imaging. In the baseline cohort, 247 participants were Black (37.8%) and 394 were White (60.2%); in the follow-up cohort, 156 were Black (36.0%) and 277 were White (64.0%). Cross-sectionally, FA and MD were associated with CBF in most regions evaluated, with lower CBF values associated with lower FA or higher MD values, including the frontal white matter lobes (for CBF and MD: mean [SE] β = -1.4 [0.5] × 10-6; for CBF and FA: mean [SE] β = 2.9 [1.0] × 10-4) and the parietal white matter lobes (for CBF and MD: mean [SE] β = -2.4 [0.6] × 10-6; for CBF and FA: mean [SE] β = 4.4 [1.1] × 10-4). Lower CBF values at baseline were also significantly associated with steeper regional decreases in FA or increases in MD in most brain regions investigated, including the frontal (for CBF and MD: mean [SE] β = -1.1 [0.6] × 10-6; for CBF and FA: mean [SE] β = 2.9 [1.0] × 10-4) and parietal lobes (for CBF and MD: mean [SE] β = -1.5 [0.7] × 10-6; for CBF and FA: mean [SE] β = 4.4 [1.1] × 10-4). Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this longitudinal cohort study of the association between CBF and diffusion tensor imaging metrics suggest that blood flow may be significantly associated with brain tissue microstructure. This work may lay the foundation for investigations to clarify the nature of early brain damage in neurodegeneration.

These cells generate local Ca releases (LCRs) that activate Na/Ca exchanger current, which accelerates diastolic depolarization and determines the pace. LCRs are generated by clusters of ryanodine receptors, Ca release units (CRUs), residing in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. While CRU distribution exhibits substantial heterogeneity, its functional importance remains unknown. Using numerical modeling, here we show that with a square lattice distribution of CRUs, Ca-induced-Ca-release propagation during diastolic depolarization is insufficient for pacemaking within a broad range of realistic ICaL densities. Allowing each CRU to deviate randomly from its lattice position allows sparks to propagate, as observed experimentally. As disorder increases, the CRU distribution exhibits larger empty spaces and simultaneously CRU clusters, as in Poisson clumping. Propagating within the clusters, Ca release becomes synchronized, increasing action potential rate and reviving pacemaker function of dormant/ nonfiring cells. However, cells with fully disordered CRU positions could not reach low firing rates and their β-adrenergic–receptor stimulation effect was substantially decreased. Inclusion of Cav1.3, a low-voltage activation L-type Ca channel isoform into ICaL, strongly increases recruitment of CRUs to fire during diastolic depolarization, increasing robustness of pacemaking and complementing effects of CRU distribution. Thus, order/disorder in CRU locations along with Cav1.3 expression regulates pacemaker function via synchronization of CRU firing. Excessive CRU disorder and/or overexpression of Cav1.3 boosts pacemaker function in the basal state, but limits the rate range, which may contribute to heart rate range decline with age and disease.",7,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,e202113061,23460,NIH,ZIAAG000844,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,172,00221295,NA,35943725,NA,NA

Here, we report that long-term wheel-running produced a more robust increase in c-fos expression in the red nucleus (RN) than in other brain regions. Anatomic and functional assays demonstrated that most RN magnocellular portion (RNm) neurons are glutamatergic. Wheel-running activates a subset of RNm glutamate neurons that project to ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons. Optogenetic stimulation of this pathway was rewarding, as assessed by intracranial self-stimulation and conditioned place preference, whereas optical inhibition blocked wheel-running behavior. Running wheel access decreased cocaine self-administration and cocaine seeking during extinction. Last, optogenetic stimulation of the RNm-to-VTA glutamate pathway inhibited responding to cocaine.

Voxelwise image segmentation enables quantification of tissue properties including area, intensity, and texture. Deep learning approaches have had substantial success in medical image segmentation, but they typically require a significant amount of data. Due to the high cost of manual annotation, training deep learning models with limited human label data is desirable, but it is a challenging problem. Approach: Inspired by transfer learning, we proposed a two-stage deep learning pipeline to address the thigh and lower leg segmentation issue. We studied three datasets, 3022 thigh slices and 8939 lower leg slices from the BLSA dataset and 121 thigh slices from the GESTALT study. First, we generated pseudo labels for thigh based on approximate handcrafted approaches using CT intensity and anatomical morphology. Then, those pseudo labels were fed into deep neural networks to train models from scratch. Finally, the first stage model was loaded as the initialization and fine-tuned with a more limited set of expert human labels of the thigh. Results: We evaluated the performance of this framework on 73 thigh CT images and obtained an average Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.927 across muscle, internal bone, cortical bone, subcutaneous fat, and intermuscular fat. To test the generalizability of the proposed framework, we applied the model on lower leg images and obtained an average DSC of 0.823.

The underlying lamin-associated mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we report that lamin A/C-null mouse embryo fibroblasts (Lmna−/− MEFs) and human progerin-expressing HGPS fibroblasts both display reduced NAD+ levels, unstable mitochondrial DNA and attenuated bioenergetics. This mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with reduced chromatin recruitment (Lmna−/− MEFs) or low levels (HGPS) of PGC1, the key transcription factor for mitochondrial homeostasis. Lmna−/− MEFs showed reduced expression of the NAD+biosynthesis enzyme NAMPT and attenuated activity of the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT1. We find high PARylation in lamin A/C-aberrant cells, further decreasing the NAD+ pool and consistent with impaired DNA base excision repair in both cell models, a condition that fuels DNA damage-induced PARylation under oxidative stress. Further, ATACsequencing revealed a substantially altered chromatin landscape in Lmna−/− MEFs, including aberrantly reduced accessibility at the Nampt gene promoter.

However, it is not clear which platform is the most efficient in promoting home HIV self-testing, given that the users of various platforms may have different characteristics that impact their readiness for HIV testing. Objective: This study aimed to compare the relative effectiveness of social media sites, dating apps, and information search sites in promoting HIV self-testing among minority men who have sex with men (MSM) at an increased risk of HIV infection. Test kit order rates were used as a proxy to evaluate promotion effectiveness. In addition, we assessed differences in characteristics between participants who ordered and did not order an HIV test kit. Methods: Culturally appropriate advertisements were placed on popular sites of three different platforms: social media sites (Facebook, Instagram), dating apps (Grindr, Jack’D), and information search sites (Google, Bing). Advertisements targeted young (18-30 years old) and minority (Black or Latinx) MSM at risk of HIV exposure. Recruitment occurred in 2 waves, with each wave running advertisements on 1 platform of each type over the same period. Participants completed a baseline survey assessing sexual or injection use behavior, substance use including alcohol, psychological readiness to test, attitudes toward HIV testing and treatment, and HIV-related stigma.

Follow-up assessments were conducted to assess HIV self-test kit use and uptake of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) at 14 and 60 days post enrollment. Results: In total, 271 participants were enrolled, and 254 were included in the final analysis. Among these 254 participants, 177 (69.7%) ordered a home HIV self-test kit. Most of the self-test kits were ordered by participants enrolled from dating apps. Due to waves with low enrollment, between wave statistical comparisons were not feasible. Within wave comparison revealed that Jack’D showed higher order rates (3.29 kits/day) compared to Instagram (0.34 kits/day) and Bing (0 kits/day). There were no associations among self-test kit ordering and HIV-related stigma, perceptions about HIV testing and treatment, and mistrust of medical organizations.

Genetic variants can be used as predictors to help inform the potential risk of adverse effects associated with drug treatments. We therefore aimed to use human genetics to help assess the risk of adverse cardiovascular events associated with therapeutically altered EPO levels to help inform clinical trials studying the safety of HIF-PHIs. By performing a genome-wide association meta-analysis of EPO (n = 6,127), we identified a cis-EPO variant (rs1617640) lying in the EPO promoter region. We validated this variant as most likely causal in controlling EPO levels by using genetic and functional approaches, including single-base gene editing. Using this variant as a partial predictor for therapeutic modulation of EPO and large genome-wide association data in Mendelian randomization tests, we found no evidence (at p < 0.05) that genetically predicted long-term rises in endogenous EPO, equivalent to a 2.2-unit increase, increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD, OR [95% CI] = 1.01 [0.93, 1.07]), myocardial infarction (MI, OR [95% CI] = 0.99 [0.87, 1.15]), or stroke (OR [95% CI] = 0.97 [0.87, 1.07]).

Progressive eGFR-decline can lead to kidney failure, necessitating dialysis or transplantation. Hundreds of loci from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for eGFR help explain population cross section variability. Since the contribution of these or other loci to eGFR-decline remains largely unknown, we derived GWAS for annual eGFR-decline and meta-analyzed 62 longitudinal studies with eGFR assessed twice over time in all 343,339 individuals and in high-risk groups. We also explored different covariate adjustment. Twelve genome-wide significant independent variants for eGFR-decline unadjusted or adjusted for eGFR-baseline (11 novel, one known for this phenotype), including nine variants robustly associated across models were identified. All loci for eGFR-decline were known for cross-sectional eGFR and thus distinguished a subgroup of eGFR loci. Seven of the nine variants showed variant-by-age interaction on eGFR cross section (further about 350,000 individuals), which linked genetic associations for eGFR-decline with age-dependency of genetic cross-section associations. Clinically important were two to four-fold greater genetic effects on eGFR-decline in high-risk subgroups.

VWF is regulated by ADAMTS13, a plasma protease that cleaves VWF into less bioactive multimers. Independent investigations have shown VWF to be elevated in SCD, whereas measurements of ADAMTS13 have been variable. Objectives: We assessed ADAMTS13 activity using multiple activity assays and measured levels of alternative VWF-cleaving proteases in SCD. Methods/ Patients: Plasma samples were collected from adult patients with SCD (n = 20) at a single institution when presenting for routine red cell exchange transfusion therapy. ADAMTS13 activity was measured by FRETS-VWF73, Technozym ADAMTS-13 Activity ELISA kit and a full-length VWF digestion reaction. Alternative VWF-cleaving proteases were identified by ELISA. A cell culture model was used to study the impact of SCD stimuli on endothelial ADAMTS13 and alternative VWF-cleaving proteases. Results: ADAMTS13 activity was found to be moderately deficient across the SCD cohort as assessed by activity assays using a VWF A2 domain peptide substrate. However, SCD plasma showed preserved ability to digest full-length VWF, suggesting assay-discrepant results. Neutrophil and endothelial-derived proteases were found to be elevated in SCD plasma. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 specifically showed preferential cleavage of full-length VWF. Upregulation of alternative VWF-cleaving proteases occurred in endothelial cells exposed to SCD stimuli such as heme and hypoxia.

Objective: The objective of this study was to assess a Lewy body dementia (LBD) case–control cohort for pathogenic variants in GRN and to test whether there is an enrichment of damaging mutations among patients with LBD. Methods: We analyzed whole-genome sequencing data generated for 2591 European-ancestry LBD cases and 4032 neurologically healthy control subjects to identify disease-causing mutations in GRN. Results: We identified six heterozygous exonic GRN mutations in seven study participants (cases: n = 6; control subjects: n = 1). Each variant was predicted to be pathogenic or likely pathogenic. We found significant enrichment of GRN loss-of-function mutations in patients with LBD compared with control subjects (Optimized Sequence Kernel Association Test P = 0.0162).

Methods: Data from the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility (AGES) Reykjavik Study on 2816 participants (aged 65 to 96 years) were used to examine the associations using multiple logistic and linear regression models. SN included questions on frequency of contact with family and friends as well as information on marital status, resulting in a score ranging from 0 (poor social network) to 3 (good social network).

However, whether different leisure time physical activity types are differentially associated with mortality risk is not established. Objectives: To examine whether participation in equivalent amounts of physical activity (7.5 to <15 metabolic equivalent of task [MET] hours per week) through different activity types is associated with mortality risk and to investigate the shape of the dose-response association. Design, Setting, and Participants: Participants in this cohort were respondents from the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study who completed the follow-up questionnaire between 2004 and 2005. This questionnaire collected data on weekly durations of different types of physical activities. Mortality was ascertained through December 31, 2019. Exposures: MET hours per week spent participating in the following activities: running, cycling, swimming, other aerobic exercise, racquet sports, golf, and walking for exercise. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality. Separate multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models were fitted to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of mortality for each of the 7 types of leisure time physical activities, as well as the sum of these activities. Results: A total of 272550 participants (157415 men [58%]; mean [SD] age at baseline, 70.5 [5.4] years [range, 59-82 years]) provided information on types of leisure time activity, and 118153 (43%) died during a mean (SD) follow-up of 12.4 (3.9) years. In comparison with those who did not participate in each activity, 7.5 to less than 15 MET hours per week of racquet sports (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.93) and running (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.92) were associated with the greatest relative risk reductions for all-cause mortality, followed by walking for exercise (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.89-0.93), other aerobic activity (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.95), golf (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.97), swimming (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92-0.98), and cycling (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99). Each activity showed a curvilinear dose-response association with mortality risk; low MET hours per week of physical activity for any given activity type were associated with a large reduction in mortality risk, with diminishing returns for each increment in activity thereafter. Associations were similar for cardiovascular and cancer mortality.

Whether the association between lifestyle activities and cognitive reserve differs by sex and APOE4 status is an understudied yet critical component for informing targeted prevention strategies. The current study examined interactions between sex and physical or cognitive activities on cognitive reserve for speed and memory in older adults. Methods Research participants with unimpaired cognition, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia from the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Cohort were included in this study. Cognitive reserve scores for speed and memory were calculated by regressing out hippocampal volume, total gray matter volume, and white matter hyperintensity volume from composite cognitive scores for speed and memory, respectively. Self-reported physical activity was assessed using the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire, converted to metabolic equivalents (METS). Self-reported cognitive activity (COGACT) was calculated as the sum of 3 yes/no questions. Sex by activity interactions and sex-stratified analyses were conducted using multivariable linear regression models, including a secondary analysis with APOE4 as a moderating factor. Results Seven hundred fifty-eight participants (mean age = 76.11 ± 6.31 years, 62% women) were included in this study. Higher METS was associated with greater speed reserve in women (β = 0.04, CI 0.0-08) but not in men (β = 0.004, CI -0.04 to 0.05). METS was not associated with memory reserve in women or men. More COGACT was associated with greater speed reserve in the cohort (β = 0.13, CI 0.05-0.21). More COGACT had a trend for greater memory reserve in women (β = 0.06, CI -0.02 to 0.14) but not in men (β = -0.04, CI -0.16 to 0.08). Only among women, APOE4 carrier status attenuated relationships between METS and speed reserve (β = -0.09, CI -0.22 to 0.04) and between COGACT and both speed (β = -0.26, CI -0.63 to 0.11) and memory reserves (β = -0.20, CI -0.50.0 to 093). Discussion The associations of self-reported physical and cognitive activities with cognitive reserve are more pronounced in women, although APOE4 attenuates these associations.

The previous largest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified SNCA and TMEM175 loci on chromosome (Chr) 4 with a significant influence on the AAO of PD; these have not been independently replicated. This study aims to conduct a meta-analysis of GWAS of PD AAO and validate previously observed findings in worldwide populations. Methods A meta-analysis was performed on PD AAO GWAS of 30 populations of predominantly European ancestry from the Comprehensive Unbiased Risk Factor Assessment for Genetics and Environment in Parkinson's Disease (COURAGE-PD) Consortium. This was followed by combining our study with the largest publicly available European ancestry dataset compiled by the International Parkinson Disease Genomics Consortium (IPDGC). Results The COURAGE-PD Consortium included a cohort of 8,535 patients with PD (91.9%: Europeans and 9.1%: East Asians). The average AAO in the COURAGE-PD dataset was 58.9 years (SD = 11.6), with an underrepresentation of females (40.2%). The heritability estimate for AAO in COURAGE-PD was 0.083 (SE = 0.057). None of the loci reached genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10-8). Nevertheless, the COURAGE-PD dataset confirmed the role of the previously published TMEM175 variant as a genetic determinant of the AAO of PD with Bonferroni-corrected nominal levels of significance (p < 0.025): (rs34311866: β(SE)COURAGE = 0.477(0.203), pCOURAGE = 0.0185). The subsequent meta-analysis of COURAGE-PD and IPDGC datasets (Ntotal = 25,950) led to the identification of 2 genome-wide significant association signals on Chr 4, including the previously reported SNCA locus (rs983361: β(SE)COURAGE+IPDGC = 0.720(0.122), pCOURAGE+IPDGC = 3.13 × 10-9) and a novel BST1 locus (rs4698412: β(SE)COURAGE+IPDGC = -0.526(0.096), pCOURAGE+IPDGC = 4.41 × 10-8).

We constructed group-level covariance networks based on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and gray matter volume (GMV) maps across 74 gray matter regions.

Next, CBF and GMV covariance network topologies were compared between Lo- and Hi-WMH groups at global (clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, global efficiency) and regional (degree, betweenness centrality, local efficiency) levels. At the global level, there were no between-group differences in either CBF or GMV covariance networks.

In our aged mice (18 months old) study, BG supplementation (300 mg/kg) for 4 weeks altered hepatic genes involved in the aging process. Furthermore, we found BG supplementation downregulated age-related inflammatory genes, especially in the complement system. Based on this observation, we demonstrated that BG supplementation led to less activation of the canonical senescence pathway, p53-dependent p21 and p16, in multiple metabolic organs such as liver, skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue.

To test the breadth of protection, we used recombinant mouse-adapted A/California/2009 (maA/Cal/09) H1N1 viruses containing mutations at one (1M), two (2M), or three (3M) antigenic sites, in addition to a virus containing the 1M mutation and a substitution of the Ca2 antigenic site (Sub) with one derived from an H5 hemagglutinin (HA) to challenge mice of both sexes. Following maA/ Cal/09 vaccination, females produced greater virus-specific, class-switched total IgG and IgG2c antibodies against the vaccine and all mutant viruses, and antibodies from females recognized a greater number of unique, linear HA epitopes than did antibodies from males. While females had greater neutralizing antibody titers against the vaccine virus, both sexes showed a lower neutralization capacity against mutant viruses. After virus challenge, vaccinated females had lower pulmonary virus titers and reduced morbidity than males for the 1M and 2M viruses, but not the Sub virus. Females generated greater numbers of germinal center (GC) B cells containing superior somatic hypermutation (SHM) frequencies than vaccinated males. Deletion of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (Aicda) eliminated female-biased immunity and protection against the 2M virus. Harnessing methods to improve GC B cell responses and frequencies of SHM, especially in males, should be considered in the development of universal influenza vaccines. IMPORTANCE Adult females develop greater antibody responses to influenza vaccines than males. We hypothesized that female-biased immunity and protection would be dependent on the extent of virus diversity as well as molecular mechanisms in B cells which constrain the breadth of epitope recognition. We developed a panel of mouse-adapted (ma) A/Cal/09 viruses that had mutations in the immunodominant hemagglutinin. Following vaccination against maA/Cal/09, females were better able to neutralize maA/Cal/09 than males, but neutralization of mutant maA/Cal/09 viruses was equally poor in both sexes, despite vaccinated females being better protected against these viruses. Vaccinated females benefited from the greater production of class-switched, somatically hypermutated antibodies generated in germinal center B cells, which increased recognition of more diverse maA/Cal/09 hemagglutinin antigen epitopes.

Persistent PTH is disabling and frequently unresponsive to treatment and is often migrainous. Here, we describe a trial assessing whether dietary modifications to increase n-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and reduce n-6 linoleic acid (LA), will alter nociceptive lipid mediators and result in clinical improvements in persistent PTH. Methods: This prospective, randomized, controlled trial tests the efficacy, safety, and biochemical effects of targeted, controlled alterations in dietary n-3 and n-6 fatty acids in 122 adult SMs and military healthcare beneficiaries with diagnosed TBI associated with actively managed persistent frequent (>8 /month) PTH with migraine. Following a 4-week baseline, participants are randomized to one of two equally intensive dietary regimens for 12 additional weeks: 1) increased n-3 EPA + DHA with low n-6 LA (H3L6); 2) usual US dietary content of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids (Control). During the intervention, participants receive diet arm-specific study oils and foods sufficient for 75% of caloric needs and comprehensive dietary counseling. Participants complete daily headache diaries throughout the intervention. Clinical outcomes, including the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), headache hours per day, circulating blood fatty acid levels, and bioactive metabolites, are measured pre-randomization and at 6 and 12 weeks. Planned primary analyses include pre-post comparisons of treatment groups on clinical measures using ANCOVA and mixed-effects models.

Often, race, ethnicity, and the social determinants of health are associated with dietary intake and related health disparities. This report describes the nutrition health disparities research supported by NIH over the past decade and offers future research opportunities relevant to NIH's mission as described in the Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition Research. Methods: Data were extracted from an internal reporting system from FY2010 to FY2019 using the Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization spending categories for Nutrition and Health Disparities. Results: Over the past decade, NIH-supported nutrition and health disparities research increased, from 860 grants in 2010 to 937 grants in FY2019, whereas total nutrition and health disparities funding remained relatively stable. The top 5 Institutes/Centers that funded nutrition and health disparities research (on the basis of both grant numbers and dollars) were identified. Principal areas of focus included several chronic diseases (e.g., obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease) and research disciplines (e.g., clinical research and behavioral and social science).

Methods: We conducted a randomised-controlled feeding study of different CR diets in 36 people with MS over 8 weeks.

Methods: We calculated polygenic risk score to identify controls and matched PD cases with the highest burden of genetic risk for PD in the discovery cohort (International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium, 7,204 PD cases and 9,412 controls) and validation cohorts (Comprehensive Unbiased Risk Factor Assessment for Genetics and Environment in Parkinson's Disease, 8,968 cases and 7,598 controls; UK Biobank, 2,639 PD cases and 14,301 controls; Accelerating Medicines Partnership–Parkinson's Disease Initiative, 2,248 cases and 2,817 controls). A genome-wide association study meta-analysis was performed on these individuals to understand genetic variation associated with resistance to disease. We further constructed a polygenic resilience score, and performed multimarker analysis of genomic annotation (MAGMA) gene-based analyses and functional enrichment analyses. Results: A higher polygenic resilience score was associated with a lower risk for PD (β = −0.054, standard error [SE] = 0.022, p = 0.013). Although no single locus reached genome-wide significance, MAGMA gene-based analyses nominated TBCA as a putative gene. Furthermore, we estimated the narrow-sense heritability associated with resilience to PD (h2 = 0.081, SE = 0.035, p = 0.0003). Subsequent functional enrichment analysis highlighted histone methylation as a potential pathway harboring resilience alleles that could mitigate the effects of PD risk loci. Interpretation: The present study represents a novel and comprehensive assessment of heritable genetic variation contributing to PD resistance. We show that a genetic resilience score can modify the penetrance of PD genetic risk factors and therefore protect individuals carrying a high-risk genetic burden from developing PD.

DJ-1 has an established role as a redox-regulated protein that defends against oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Multiple studies have suggested that DJ-1 is also a protein/nucleic acid deglycase that plays a key role in the repair of glycation damage caused by methylglyoxal (MG), a reactive α-keto aldehyde formed by central metabolism. Contradictory reports suggest that DJ-1 is a glyoxalase but not a deglycase and does not play a major role in glycation defense. Resolving this issue is important for understanding how DJ-1 protects cells against insults that can cause disease. We find that DJ-1 reduces levels of reversible adducts of MG with guanine and cysteine in vitro. The steady-state kinetics of DJ-1 acting on reversible hemithioacetal substrates are fitted adequately with a computational kinetic model that requires only a DJ-1 glyoxalase activity, supporting the conclusion that deglycation is an apparent rather than a true activity of DJ-1. Sensitive and quantitative isotope-dilution mass spectrometry shows that DJ-1 modestly reduces the levels of some irreversible guanine and lysine glycation products in primary and cultured neuronal cell lines and whole mouse brain, consistent with a small but measurable effect on total neuronal glycation burden. However, DJ-1 does not improve cultured cell viability in exogenous MG. In total, our results suggest that DJ-1 is not a deglycase and has only a minor role in protecting neurons against methylglyoxal toxicity.

We aimed to compare meal-stimulated GDF15 and cortisol response in adults with and without WR after sleeve gastrectomy (SG). We hypothesized that GDF15 and cortisol response to meal tolerance test (MTT) will be lower in those with versus without WR after SG. Methods: Cross-sectional study comprised 21 adults without diabetes, who underwent SG. WR was defined as 100 × (current weight − nadir)/(preoperative weight − nadir) > 10%.

As such, kinase inhibitors are being considered as therapeutic agents for PD. It is therefore of interest to understand the mechanism(s) by which LRRK2 is activated during cellular signaling. Lysosomal membrane damage represents one way of activating LRRK2 and leads to phosphorylation of downstream RAB substrates and recruitment of the motor adaptor protein JIP4. However, it is unclear whether the activation of LRRK2 would be seen at other membranes of the endolysosomal system, where LRRK2 has also shown to be localized, or whether these signaling events can be induced without membrane damage. Here, we use a rapamycin-dependent oligomerization system to direct LRRK2 to various endomembranes including the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, the plasma membrane, recycling, early, and late endosomes. Irrespective of membrane location, the recruitment of LRRK2 to membranes results in local accumulation of phosphorylated RAB10, RAB12, and JIP4. We also show that endogenous RAB29, previously nominated as an activator of LRRK2 based on overexpression, is not required for activation of LRRK2 at the Golgi nor lysosome.

Yet, the interrelatedness of upper and lower extremity motor impairments and the magnitude of their contribution to slow gait and mobility difficulty are not well investigated. Methods: Participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (N = 728, aged 50-99) completed motor and physical function tests including grip and knee extension strength, pegboard, finger tapping, standing balance, chair stands, fast-paced 400-m walk, and usual gait speed. Slow gait was defined as usual gait speed <1.0 m/s. Mobility difficulty was defined as self-reported difficulty walking ¼ mile or climbing stairs. Structural equation modeling examined the interrelationships of motor measures and their contributions to slow gait and mobility difficulty, adjusting for demographics and comorbidities. Results: Poorer manual dexterity (-0.571 standard deviation [SD] units, p <. 001) and lower muscle strength (upper and lower extremity; -0.447 SD units, p =. 014) were most strongly associated with slow gait speed, followed by slower chair stand pace (-0.195 SD units, p =. 002) and greater lap time variation (0.102 SD units, p =. 028).

However, the mechanisms linking GWAS variants to pathogenicity are largely unknown. Here, we found that the influence of PD-associated noncoding variation on LRRK2 expression is specifically propagated through microglia and not by other cell types that express LRRK2 in the human brain. We find microglia-specific regulatory chromatin regions that modulate the LRRK2 expression in human frontal cortex and substantia nigra and confirm these results in a human-induced pluripotent stem cell–derived microglia model.

Members of the NAD+-dependent class III histone deacetylase family, sirtuins, are conserved regulators of aging and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The sirtuin SIRT6 is predominantly located in the nucleus and shows deacetylase activity for acetylated histone 3 lysine 56 and lysine 9 as well as for some non-histone proteins. Over the past decade, experimental analyses in rodents and non-human primates have demonstrated the critical role of SIRT6 in extending lifespan. Recent studies highlighted the pleiotropic protective actions of SIRT6 in angiogenesis and cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, hypertension, heart failure, and stroke.

First, we discovered that in human HCT116 colon cancer cells, knock-out (KO) of TOP3B had similar effects on mRNA turnover and translation as did TDRD3-KO, while FMRP-KO resulted in rather distinct effects, indicating that TOP3B had stronger coordination with TDRD3 than FMRP in mRNA regulation. Second, we identified TOP3B-bound mRNAs in HCT116 cells; we found that while TOP3B did not directly influence the stability or translation of most TOP3B target mRNAs, it stabilized a subset of target mRNAs but had a more complex effect on translation-enhancing for some mRNAs whereas reducing for others. Interestingly, a point mutation that specifically disrupted TOP3B catalytic activity only partially recapitulated the effects of TOP3B-KO on mRNA stability and translation, suggesting that the impact of TOP3B on target mRNAs is partly linked to its ability to change topology of mRNAs.

For each PD patient at each time point, we calculated the difference between CESD-10 score and its expected value estimated based on data from individuals without PD, and then realigned the time scale in reference to the year of PD diagnosis. We examined longitudinal changes in CESD-10 scores before and after PD diagnosis using a joint modeling approach to account for competing risks of non-participation and death. Results A total of 79 PD patients were identified at enrollment or during the follow-up, with repeatedly assessed depressive symptom data up to 9 years before and after PD diagnosis. We found a monotonic trend of increasing CESD-10 score in PD patients throughout the observational period (p = 0.002).

Conventional diffusion tensor microstructure indices are the most age-sensitive measures, with positive age associations for diffusivities and negative age associations with anisotropies, with similar patterns observed across all pathways. Similarly, pathway shape measures also change with age, with negative age associations for most length, surface area, and volume-based features. A particularly novel finding of this study is that while trends were homogeneous throughout the brain for microstructure features, macrostructural features demonstrated heterogeneity across pathways, whereby several projection, thalamic, and commissural tracts exhibited more decline with age compared to association and limbic tracts.

Methods: Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the associations of DSI and single sensory impairment (hearing, vision) with incident mobility difficulty (many problems or inability to walk ¼ mile and/or climb 10 steps) and ADL difficulty up to six years of follow-up among 2020 participants of the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study, a cohort of older adults aged 70–79 years from Pittsburgh, PA and Memphis, TN. Vision impairment (VI) was defined as impaired visual acuity (20/50 or worse on Bailey-Lovie distance test) and contrast sensitivity (<1.3 log units on Pelli-Robson test), and hearing impairment (HI) was defined as pure-tone average in better-hearing ear >25 decibels.

Participants: A total of 114 participants with untreated HIV and OUD (62% male; 56% black, 12% Hispanic; positive for fentanyl (62%), other opioids (47%) and cocaine (60%) at baseline). Enrollment halted early due to slow recruitment. Intervention: HIV clinic-based extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX; n = 55) versus treatment as usual (TAU) with buprenorphine or methadone (TAU; n = 59). Measurements: Treatment group differences were compared for the primary outcome of viral suppression (HIV RNA ≤ 200 copies/ml) at 24 weeks and secondary outcomes included past 30-day use of opioids at 24 weeks. Findings: Fewer XR-NTX participants initiated medication compared with TAU participants (47 versus 73%).

Glucose hypometabolism, extracellular Amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, and intracellular Tau deposition are cardinal features of AD and display characteristic spatial patterns in the brain. We hypothesize that regional differences in underlying gene expression confer either resistance or susceptibility to AD pathogenic processes and are associated with these spatial patterns. Data-driven methods for the identification of genes involved in AD pathogenesis complement hypothesis-driven approaches that reflect current theories about the disease. Here we present a data driven method for the identification of genes involved in AD pathogenesis based on comparing spatial patterns of normal gene expression to Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images of glucose hypometabolism, Aβ deposition, and Tau deposition. Methods: We performed correlations between the cerebral cortex microarray samples from the six cognitively normal (CN) post-mortem Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) specimens and PET FDG-18, AV-45, and AV-1451 tracer images from AD and CN participants in the Alzheimer’s Disease and Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Correlation coefficients for each gene by each ADNI subject were then entered into a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to determine sets that best classified the AD and CN groups. Pathway analysis via BioPlanet 2019 was then used to infer the function of implicated genes. Results: We identified distinct sets of genes strongly associated with each PET modality. Pathway analyses implicated novel genes involved in mitochondrial function, and Notch signaling, as well as genes previously associated with AD.

In this study, we report that RECQL4 stabilizes the NHEJ machinery at DSBs to promote repair. Specifically, we find that RECQL4 interacts with the NHEJ core factor DNA-PKcs and the interaction is increased following IR. RECQL4 promotes DNA end bridging mediated by DNA-PKcs and Ku70/80 in vitro and the accumulation/retention of NHEJ factors at DSBs in vivo. Moreover, interaction between DNA-PKcs and the other core NHEJ proteins following IR treatment is attenuated in the absence of RECQL4. These data indicate that RECQL4 promotes the stabilization of the NHEJ factors at DSBs to support formation of the NHEJ long-range synaptic complex. In addition, we observed that the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs is required for accumulation of RECQL4 to DSBs and that DNA-PKcs phosphorylates RECQL4 at six serine/threonine residues. Blocking phosphorylation at these sites reduced the recruitment of RECQL4 to DSBs, attenuated the interaction between RECQL4 and NHEJ factors, destabilized interactions between the NHEJ machinery, and resulted in decreased NHEJ.

Metastasizing OvCa cells adhere to the omentum, a peritoneal structure rich in collagen, adipocytes, and immune cells. Ultrastructural changes in the omentum and the omental collagen matrix with aging have not been evaluated. Aim: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that age-related changes in collagen in the ovarian tumor microenvironment promote OvCa metastatic success in the aged host. Methods/Results: Young (3–6 months) and aged mice (20–23 months) were used to study the role of aging in metastatic success. Intra-peritoneal (IP) injection of ID8Trp53–/– OvCa cells showed enhanced IP dissemination in aged versus young mice. In vitro assays using purified collagen demonstrated reduced collagenolysis of aged fibers, as visualized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and quantified with a hydroxyproline release assay. Omental tumors in young and aged mice showed similar collagen deposition; however enhanced intra-tumoral collagen remodeling was seen in aged mice probed with a biotinylated collagen hybridizing peptide (CHP). In contrast, second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy showed significant differences in collagen fiber structure and organization in omental tissue, and SEM demonstrated enhanced omental fenestration in aged omenta. Combined SHG and Alexa Fluor-CHP microscopy in vivo demonstrated that peri-tumoral collagen was remodeled more extensively in young mice. This collagen population represents truly aged host collagen, in contrast to intra-tumoral collagen that is newly synthesized, likely by cancer-associated fibroblasts. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that tumors in an aged host can grow with minimal collagen remodeling, while tumors in the young host must remodel peri-tumoral collagen to enable effective proliferation, providing a mechanism whereby age-induced ultrastructural changes in collagen and collagen-rich omenta establish a permissive premetastatic niche contributing to enhanced OvCa metastatic success in the aged host.",6,Journal,ar,Article,100,14,14,NA,21101209860,NIGMS,UO1 AG CA236797,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,265,NA,116-129,NA,aging | collagen | metastasis | omentum | ovarian cancer,NA

Identification of biallelic PRKN patients at the population scale, however, remains a challenge, as roughly half are copy number variants and many single nucleotide polymorphisms are of unclear significance. Additionally, the true prevalence and disease risk associated with heterozygous PRKN mutations is unclear, as a comprehensive assessment of PRKN mutations has not been performed at a population scale. To address these challenges, we evaluated PRKN mutations in two cohorts with near complete genotyping of both single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variants: the NIH-PD + AMP-PD cohort, the largest Parkinson's disease case-control cohort with whole genome sequencing data from 4094 participants, and the UK Biobank, the largest cohort study with whole exome sequencing and genotyping array data from 200 606 participants. Using the NIH-PD participants, who were genotyped using whole genome sequencing, genotyping array, and multi-plex ligation-dependent probe amplification, we validated genotyping array for the detection of copy number variants. Additionally, in the NIH-PD cohort, functional assays of patient fibroblasts resolved variants of unclear significance in biallelic carriers and suggested that cryptic loss of function variants in monoallelic carriers are not a substantial confounder for association studies. In the UK Biobank, we identified 2692 PRKN copy number variants from genotyping array data from nearly half a million participants (the largest collection to date). Deletions or duplications involving exon 2 accounted for roughly half of all copy number variants and the vast majority (88%) involved exons 2, 3, or 4.

Recent evidence suggests that inflammation plays an important role in the propagation of protein aggregates. However, the mechanism by which inflammation regulates the propagation of aggregates remains unknown. Here, using in vitro cultures, we found that soluble factors secreted from activated microglia promote cell-to-cell propagation of α-synuclein and further showed that among these soluble factors, TNF-α had the most robust stimulatory activity. Treatment of neurons with TNF-α triggered cellular senescence, as shown by transcriptomic analyses demonstrating induction of senescence-associated genes and immunoanalysis of senescence phenotype marker proteins. Interestingly, secretion of α-synuclein was increased in senescent neurons, reflecting acquisition of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Using vacuolin-1, an inhibitor of lysosomal exocytosis, and RNAi against rab27a, we demonstrated that the SASP was mediated by lysosomal exocytosis. Correlative light and electron microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that propagating α-synuclein aggregates were present in electron-dense lysosome-like compartments. TNF-α promoted the SASP through stimulation of lysosomal exocytosis, thereby increasing the secretion of α-synuclein. Collectively, these results suggest that TNF-α is the major inflammatory factor that drives cell-to-cell propagation of α-synuclein by promoting the SASP and subsequent secretion of α-synuclein.",42,Journal,ar,Article,100,12,12,NA,17476,NRF,NRF-2018R1A5A2025964,National Research Foundation of Korea,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,268,12263613,788-800,35790884,NA,NA

Adherence to different dietary patterns was evaluated using the Mediterranean diet score (MDS), Mediterranean–DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) score, and Alternate Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI).

Methods: We used a custom next-generation sequencing panel, including 50 LSD genes, to screen 305 patients and 207 controls (discovery cohort).

In this study, we investigated whether encouraging patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) to share autobiographical memories during formal neuropsychological testing may boost the patient–clinician relationship, and more specifically, the neuropsychologist’s level of sympathy as perceived by patients. Methods: We invited patients with mild AD to perform neuropsychological testing in two conditions. In one condition, we invited patients to retrieve and share two autobiographical memories after testing, while in a control condition, the testing session ended without asking patients to retrieve and share any autobiographical memories. After the two conditions, patients were invited to rate the neuropsychologist’s level of sympathy towards them. Results: Analysis demonstrated that patients perceived a higher level of sympathy when their neuropsychologist invited them to retrieve and share past personal experiences. Discussion: By inviting patients with AD to retrieve past personal experiences, clinicians can promote a sense of sharing, create a social bond and, consequently, enhance the therapeutic relationship. In other words, by inviting patients with AD to share autobiographical memories, clinicians can promote a “social glue” with their patients, boosting mutual sympathy and patients’ well-being.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,NA,28496,NIH,ZIAAG000975,National Institutes of Health,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,281,15940667,1295-1301,35091969,Alzheimer’s disease | Autobiographical memory | Sympathy | Therapeutic relationship: neuropsychological testing,NA

Such origin dormancy is achieved, in part, by an interaction with the metabolic sensor SIRT1 deacetylase. We report here that dormant origins are a group of consistent, pre-determined genomic sequences that are distinguished from baseline (i.e. ordinarily active) origins by their preferential association with two phospho-isoforms of the helicase component MCM2. During normal unperturbed cell growth, baseline origins, but not dormant origins, associate with a form of MCM2 that is phosphorylated by DBF4-dependent kinase (DDK) on serine 139 (pS139-MCM2). This association facilitates the initiation of DNA replication from baseline origins. Concomitantly, SIRT1 inhibits Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR)-kinase-mediated phosphorylation of MCM2 on serine 108 (pS108-MCM2) by deacetylating the ATR-interacting protein DNA topoisomerase II binding protein 1 (TOPBP1), thereby preventing ATR recruitment to chromatin. In cells devoid of SIRT1 activity, or challenged by replication stress, this inhibition is circumvented, enabling ATR-mediated S108-MCM2 phosphorylation. In turn, pS108-MCM2 enables DDK-mediated phosphorylation on S139-MCM2 and facilitates replication initiation at dormant origins. These observations suggest that replication origin dormancy and activation are regulated by distinct post-translational MCM modifications that reflect a balance between SIRT1 activity and ATR signaling.",15,Journal,ar,Article,100,13,13,NA,14204,NIA,ZIC AG000615-14,National Institute on Aging,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,282,03051048,5111-5128,35524559,NA,NA

Here, we analyze and manipulate microglial aging within the basal ganglia, brain circuits that exhibit prominent regional microglial heterogeneity and where neurons are vulnerable to functional decline and neurodegenerative disease. In male and female mice, we demonstrate that VTA and SNc microglia exhibit unique and premature responses to aging, compared with cortex and NAc microglia. This is associated with localized VTA/SNc neuroinflammation that may compromise synaptic function as early as middle age. Surprisingly, systemic inflammation, local neuron death, and astrocyte aging do not appear to underlie these early aging responses of VTA and SNc microglia. Instead, we found that microglial lysosome status was tightly linked to early aging of VTA microglia. Microglial ablation/repopulation normalized VTA microglial lysosome swelling and suppressed increases in VTA microglial density during aging. In contrast, CX3CR1 receptor KO exacerbated VTA microglial lysosome rearrangements and VTA microglial proliferation during aging.

Distances between the V gene and enhancer ranged from ∼2.3 kb of intron DNA for rearrangements using J1, ∼2.0 kb for rearrangements using J2, ∼1.6 kb for rearrangements using J3 (H) or 4 (κ), and 1.1 kb for rearrangements using J4 (H) or 5 (κ). Strikingly, >90% of intron mutations occurred within 1 kb downstream of the J gene for both H and k clones, regardless of which J gene was used.

Foundational psychosocial and behavioral approaches to promote healthy aging and strategies to disseminate this information were discussed. The following synopsis documents the conversation, describes the state of the science, and outlines a path forward for clinical practice. Wellness, in its broadest sense, prioritizes an orientation toward health, and an embrace of behaviors that will promote it. It involves a journey to improve and maintain physical and mental health and overall well-being to fully engage and live one's best life. It is more about recognizing and optimizing what one can do than what one cannot do and emphasizes the individual's agency over changing what they are able to change. Wellness is therefore not a passive state but rather an active goal to be sought continually. When viewed in this fashion, wellness is accessible to all.

We studied the effect of the in vivo administration of MBG or HS diet on blood pressure (BP), CAS, and behavioral function in young DSS rats and normotensive Sprague–Dawley rats (SD), the genetic background for DSS rats. Eight-week-old male SD and DSS rats were given an HS diet (8% NaCl, n = 18/group) or a low-salt diet (LS; 0.1% NaCl, n = 14–18/group) for 8 weeks or MBG (50 µg/kg/day, n = 15–18/group) administered via osmotic minipumps for 4 weeks in the presence of the LS diet. The MBG-treated groups received the LS diet. The systolic BP (SBP); the aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV), a marker of CAS; MBG levels; spatial memory, measured by a water maze task; and tissue collection for the histochemical analysis were assessed at the end of the experiment. DSS-LS rats had higher SBP, higher aPWV, and poorer spatial memory than SD-LS rats. The administration of stressors HS and MBG increased aPWV, SBP, and aortic wall collagen abundance in both strains vs. their LS controls. In SD rats, HS or MBG administration did not affect heart parameters, as assessed by ECHO vs. the SD-LS control. In DSS rats, impaired whole-heart structure and function were observed after HS diet administration in DSS-HS vs. DSS-LS rats. MBG treatment did not affect the ECHO parameters in DSS-MBG vs. DSS-LS rats. The HS diet led to an increase in endogenous plasma and urine MBG levels in both SD and DSS groups. Thus, the prohypertensive and profibrotic effect of HS diet might be partially attributed to an increase in MBG. The prohypertensive and profibrotic functions of MBG were pronounced in both DSS and SD rats, although quantitative PCR revealed that different profiles of profibrotic genes in DSS and SD rats was activated after MBG or HS administration. Spatial memory was not affected by HS diet or MBG treatment in either SD or DSS rats. Impaired cognitive function was associated with higher BP, CAS, and cardiovascular remodeling in young DSS-LS rats, as compared to young SD-LS rats. MBG and HS had similar effects on the cardiovascular system and its function in DSS and SD rats, although the rate of change in SD rats was lower than in DSS rats. The absence of a cumulative effect of increased aPWV and BP on spatial memory can be explained by the cerebrovascular and brain plasticity in young rats, which help the animals to tolerate CAS elevated by HS and MBG and to counterbalance the profibrotic effect of heightened MBG.",5,Journal,ar,Article,100,14,14,4563,25879,NIH,ZIAAG000846,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,296,16616596,NA,35562955,aortic pulse wave velocity | arterial stiffness | behavioral tests | cardiovascular remodeling | Dahl salt-sensitive rats | echocardiography | fibrosis | genes | hypertension | marinobufagenin | spatial memory | steroidal inhibitor of Na/K-ATPase | vascular dementia,NA

This longitudinal study examined a cohort of patients with minor stroke to determine the pattern of deficits, evolution over time, and factors associated with outcome. Methods: Patients admitted to the hospital with their first clinical minor stroke (NIH Stroke Scale [NIHSS] ≤ 10, absence of severe hemiparesis, aphasia, or neglect) were assessed at 1 month post-infarct, and a subset were followed over time (with 6- and 12-month evaluations). Composite scores at each time point were generated for global cognition, verbal memory, spatial memory, motor speed, processing speed, and executive function. Paired t-tests evaluated change in scores over time. Regression models identified factors associated with initial performance and better recovery. Results: Eighty patients were enrolled, evaluated at 1 month, and prospectively followed. The average age of the participants was 62.3 years, and mean education was 13.5 years. The average stroke volume was 6.6 cc; mean NIHSS score was 2.8. At 1 month, cognitive scores were below the normative range and > 1 standard deviation below the patient's peak (“recovery”) score for every cognitive domain, strongly suggesting that they were well below patients’ prestroke baselines. Forty-eight patients followed up at 6 months, and 39 at 12 months. Nearly all (98%) patients significantly improved in global cognition (averaged across domains) between 1 and 6 months. Between 6 and 12 months, recovery was variable. Higher education, occupational class, and Caucasian race were associated with higher recovery scores for most domains.

However, the relationship of other types of hypertensions, such as isolated hypertension on brain health and its comparison to systolic-diastolic hypertension (where systolic and diastolic measures are high), is still relatively unknown. Due to its increased prevalence, it is important to investigate the impact of isolated hypertension to help understand its potential impact on cognitive decline and future dementia risk. In this study, we compared a variety of global brain measures between participants with isolated hypertension to those with normal blood pressure (BP) or systolic-diastolic hypertension using the largest cohort of healthy individuals. Methods: Using the UK Biobank cohort, we carried out a cross-sectional study using 29,775 participants (mean age 63 years, 53% female) with BP measurements and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. We used linear regression models adjusted for multiple confounders to compare a variety of global, subcortical, and white matter brain measures. We compared participants with either isolated systolic or diastolic hypertension with normotensives and then with participants with systolic-diastolic hypertension. Results: The results showed that participants with isolated systolic or diastolic hypertension taking BP medications had smaller gray matter but larger white matter microstructures and macrostructures compared to normotensives. Isolated systolic hypertensives had larger total gray matter and smaller white matter traits when comparing these regions with participants with systolic-diastolic hypertension.

T2D individuals have been found to exhibit an increased fracture risk despite elevated bone mineral density (BMD) by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, BMD and FRAX-scores tend to underestimate fracture risk in T2D. New, reliable biomarkers are therefore needed. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are secreted into the circulation from cells of various tissues proportional to local disease severity. Serum miRNA-classifiers were recently found to discriminate T2D women with and without prevalent fragility fractures with high specificity and sensitivity (AUC > 0.90). However, the association of circulating miRNAs with incident fractures in T2D has not been examined yet. In 168 T2D postmenopausal women in the AGES-Reykjavik cohort, miRNAs were extracted from baseline serum and a panel of 10 circulating miRNAs known to be involved in diabetic bone disease and aging was quantified by qPCR and Ct-values extracted. Unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazard models assessed the associations between serum miRNAs and incident fragility fracture. Additionally, Receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses were performed. Of the included 168 T2D postmenopausal women who were on average 77.2 ± 5.6 years old, 70 experienced at least one incident fragility fracture during the mean follow-up of 5.8 ± 2.7 years. We found that 3 serum miRNAs were significantly associated with incident diabetic fragility fracture: while low expression of miR-19b-1-5p was associated with significantly lower risk of incident fragility fracture (HR 0.84 (95% CI: 0.71–0.99, p = 0.0323)), low expression of miR-203a and miR-31-5p was each significantly associated with a higher risk of incident fragility fracture per unit increase in Ct-value (miR-203a: HR 1.29 (95% CI: 1.12–1.49), p = 0.0004, miR-31-5p HR 1.27 (95% CI: 1.06–1.52), p = 0.009). Hazard ratios of the latter two miRNAs remained significant after adjustments for age, body mass index (BMI), areal bone mineral density (aBMD), clinical FRAX or FRAXaBMD. Women with miR-203a and miR-31-5p serum levels in the lowest expression quartiles exhibited a 2.4–3.4-fold larger fracture risk than women with miR-31-5p and miR-203a serum expressions in the highest expression quartile (0.002 ≤ p ≤ 0.039). Women with both miR-203a and miR-31-5p serum levels below the median had a significantly increased fracture risk (Unadjusted HR 3.26 (95% CI: 1.57–6.78, p = 0.001) compared to those with both expression levels above the median, stable to adjustments. We next built a diabetic fragility signature consisting of the 3 miRNAs that showed the largest associations with incident fracture (miR-203a, miR-31-5p, miR-19b-1-5p). This 3-miRNA signature showed with an AUC of 0.722 comparable diagnostic accuracy in identifying incident fractures to any of the clinical parameters such as aBMD, Clinical FRAX or FRAXaBMD alone. When the 3 miRNAs were combined with aBMD, this combined 4-feature signature performed with an AUC of 0.756 (95%CI 0.680, 0.823) significantly better than aBMD alone (AUC 0.666, 95%CI: (0.585, 0.741)) (p = 0.009).

Unraveling such heterogeneity might aid in elucidating etiological mechanisms and support precision and individualized medicine. Objective: To cross-sectionally and longitudinally delineate disease-related heterogeneity in LLD associated with neuroanatomy, cognitive functioning, clinical symptoms, and genetic profiles. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Imaging-Based Coordinate System for Aging and Neurodegenerative Diseases (iSTAGING) study is an international multicenter consortium investigating brain aging in pooled and harmonized data from 13 studies with more than 35000 participants, including a subset of individuals with major depressive disorder. Multimodal data from a multicenter sample (N = 996), including neuroimaging, neurocognitive assessments, and genetics, were analyzed in this study. A semisupervised clustering method (heterogeneity through discriminative analysis) was applied to regional gray matter (GM) brain volumes to derive dimensional representations. Data were collected from July 2017 to July 2020 and analyzed from July 2020 to December 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Two dimensions were identified to delineate LLD-associated heterogeneity in voxelwise GM maps, white matter (WM) fractional anisotropy, neurocognitive functioning, clinical phenotype, and genetics. Results: A total of 501 participants with LLD (mean [SD] age, 67.39 [5.56] years; 332 women) and 495 healthy control individuals (mean [SD] age, 66.53 [5.16] years; 333 women) were included. Patients in dimension 1 demonstrated relatively preserved brain anatomy without WM disruptions relative to healthy control individuals. In contrast, patients in dimension 2 showed widespread brain atrophy and WM integrity disruptions, along with cognitive impairment and higher depression severity. Moreover, 1 de novo independent genetic variant (rs13120336; chromosome: 4, 186387714; minor allele, G) was significantly associated with dimension 1 (odds ratio, 2.35; SE, 0.15; P = 3.14 ×108) but not with dimension 2. The 2 dimensions demonstrated significant single-nucleotide variant-based heritability of 18% to 27% within the general population (N = 12518 in UK Biobank). In a subset of individuals having longitudinal measurements, those in dimension 2 experienced a more rapid longitudinal change in GM and brain age (Cohen f2= 0.03; P =.02) and were more likely to progress to Alzheimer disease (Cohen f2= 0.03; P =.03) compared with those in dimension 1 (N = 1431 participants and 7224 scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI], Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging [BLSA], and Biomarkers for Older Controls at Risk for Dementia [BIOCARD] data sets). Conclusions and Relevance: This study characterized heterogeneity in LLD into 2 dimensions with distinct neuroanatomical, cognitive, clinical, and genetic profiles.

Understanding the factors influencing myelin synthesis and breakdown will be essential for the development and evaluation of therapeutic interventions. In this work, we assessed associations between genetic variance in apolipoprotein E (APOE) and cerebral myelin content. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) was performed on a cohort of 92 cognitively unimpaired adults ranging in age from 24 to 94 years. We measured whole-brain myelin water fraction (MWF), a direct measure of myelin content, as well as longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates (R1 and R2), sensitive measures of myelin content, in carriers of the APOE ε4 or APOE ε2 alleles and individuals with the ε33 genotype. Automated brain mapping algorithms and statistical models were used to evaluate the relationships between MWF or relaxation rates and APOE isoforms, accounting for confounding variables including age, sex, and race, in several cerebral structures. Our results indicate that carriers of APOE ε2 exhibited significantly higher myelin content, that is, higher MWF, R1 or R2 values, in most brain regions investigated as compared to noncarriers, while ε4 carriers exhibited trends toward lower myelin content compared to noncarriers. Finally, all qMRI metrics exhibited quadratic, inverted U-shape, associations with age; attributed to the development of myelination from young to middle age followed by progressive loss of myelin afterwards. Sex and race effects on myelination were, overall, nonsignificant. These findings suggest that individual genetic background may influence cerebral myelin maintenance.

Polypharmacy is associated with increased risk of frailty in epidemiologic studies, regardless of frailty definition, but the pathophysiology of the association is not well understood. This study aims to (1) assess and compare the prevalence of frailty from middle to old age following control, chronic polypharmacy or monotherapy treatment, when measured using the clinical frailty index assessment and the mouse frailty phenotype tools; and (2) to evaluate and compare the effects of chronic polypharmacy regimens with zero, low and high Drug Burden Index (DBI) and monotherapies from middle to old age on the rate of deficit accumulation on the frailty index, mean number of phenotype criteria, odds of being frail assessed by the frailty index or phenotype, and the time to onset of frailty assessed by the frailty index or phenotype. In a longitudinal study, middle-aged (12 months) male C57BL/6J(B6) mice were administered non medicated control feed and water, or therapeutic doses of different polypharmacy combinations or monotherapies in feed and/or water. Frailty assessments were performed at 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months. There was limited overlap between animals identified as frail using different frailty assessments. Polypharmacy has measurable and different effects on each frailty assessment. Long-term chronic administration of some polypharmacy and monotherapy therapeutic drug regimens increased the number of frailty deficits (clinical frailty index: low DBI polypharmacy (15 and 21 months), high DBI polypharmacy (15–21 months), oxycodone (15–18 months), oxybutynin (15–18 months), citalopram (15–21 months) and metoprolol monotherapy (15 months) and modified frailty phenotype assessment (over the whole duration of treatment, low DBI polypharmacy (adjusted Risk Ratio(aRR) = 1.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43–2.72), high DBI polypharmacy (aRR = 1.88; 95% CI 1.36–2.60), oxybutynin (aRR = 1.48; 95% CI 1.01–2.16) and citalopram monotherapy (aRR = 1.96; 95% CI 1.41–2.74), p < 0.05). The odds of developing frailty measured with the clinical frailty index increased with high DBI polypharmacy (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.13; 95% CI 1.01–9.66) and when measured with the frailty phenotype assessment increased with low DBI polypharmacy (aOR = 4.38, 95% CI 1.40–13.74), high DBI polypharmacy (aOR = 3.43; 95% CI 1.12–10.50) and citalopram monotherapy (aOR = 4.63; 95% CI 1.39–15.54)).

Methods: Secondary analysis of a randomized trial of community-dwelling adults (≥50 years) with hypertension. Participants were randomized to a systolic blood pressure (SBP) goal of <120 mm Hg (intensive treatment; n = 4678) or <140 mm Hg (Standard treatment; n = 4683). Outcomes included adjudicated MCI, MCI subtype (amnestic, non-amnestic, multi-domain, single domain), and probable dementia. Multistate survival models were used to examine transitions in cognitive status accounting for the competing risk of death. Results: Among 9361 randomized participants (mean age, 67.9 years; 3332 women [35.6%]), 640 participants met the protocol definition for MCI, with intensive treatment reducing the risk of MCI overall (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.69–0.94]), as previously reported. This effect was largely reflected in amnestic subtypes (HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.66–0.92]) and multi-domain subtypes (HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.65–0.93]). An adjudication of MCI, as compared with normal cognitive function, substantially increased the probability of progressing to probable dementia (5.9% [95% CI: 4.5%–7.7%] vs. 0.6% [95% CI: 0.3%–0.9%]) and to death (10.0% [95% CI: 8.3%–11.9%] vs. 2.3% [95% CI: 2.0%–2.7%]) within 2 years.

In this study, we wanted to determine whether NPM was similarly modulated in the skin and plasma of psoriatic patients (Pso). We found that NPM was induced in 6 skin biopsies compared to 6 normal skin biopsies and was markedly increased in lesional (LS) vs. non-lesional skin (NLS) biopsies. Moreover, NPM was also increased at the transcriptional levels in LS vs. NLS. Both the innate stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharides and Poly inositol–cytosine and adaptive stimuli, that is, cytokine mix, were able to induce the extracellular release of NPM in immortalized keratinocytes and human skin fibroblasts in the absence of cytotoxicity. Interestingly, NPM interacts with Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 in these cells and activates an NF-kB-dependent inflammatory pathway upregulating interleukin IL-6 and COX-2 gene expression. Finally, circulating NPM was increased in the plasma of 29 Pso compared to 29 healthy controls, and positively correlates with psoriasis area severity index (PASI) and with determinants of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), such as pulse wave velocity, systolic pressure, and left ventricular mass. Furthermore, NPM positively correlates with miR-200c circulating levels, which we previously showed to increase in Pso and correlate with CVD progression. Our data show that circulating miR-200c is physically associated with extracellular NPM, which most probably is responsible for its extracellular release and protection upon cytokine mix via a TLR4-mechanism.

While individual cells within SAN tissue exhibit substantial heterogeneity of their electrophysiological parameters and Ca cycling, the role of this heterogeneity for cardiac pacemaker function remains mainly unknown. Here we investigated the problem numerically in a 25 × 25 square grid of connected coupled-clock Maltsev-Lakatta cell models. The tissue models were populated by cells with different degree of heterogeneity of the two key model parameters, maximum L-type Ca current conductance (gCaL) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca pumping rate (Pup). Our simulations showed that in the areas of Pup-gCaL parametric space at the edge of the system stability, where action potential (AP) firing is absent or dysrhythmic in SAN tissue models populated with identical cells, rhythmic AP firing can be rescued by populating the tissues with heterogeneous cells. This robust SAN function is synergistic with respect to heterogeneity in gCaL and Pup and can be further strengthened by clustering of cells with similar properties. The effect of cell heterogeneity is not due to a simple summation of activity of intrinsically firing cells naturally present in heterogeneous SAN; rather AP firing cells locally and critically interact with non-firing/dormant cells. When firing cells prevail, they recruit many dormant cells to fire, strongly enhancing overall SAN function; and vice versa, prevailing dormant cells suppress AP firing in cells with intrinsic automaticity and halt SAN function. The transitions between firing and non-firing states of the system are sharp, resembling phase transitions in statistical physics. Furthermore, robust function of heterogeneous SAN tissue requires weak cell coupling, a known property of the central area of SAN where cardiac impulse emerges; stronger cell coupling reduces AP firing rate and ultimately halts SAN automaticity at the edge of stability.",12,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,845634,21100215107,NIH,undefined,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,308,NA,NA,NA,calcium release | cardiac arrhythmia | coupled-clock pacemaker system | numerical modeling | sarcoplasmic reticulum | sick sinus syndrome | sinoatrial node | sinus node arrest,NA

Methods A cohort of patients with motor neuron disease was recruited between 1993 and 2020 at the Helsinki University Hospital and 2 second-degree outpatient clinics in Helsinki. Finnish ancestry patients with ALS fulfilled the diagnosis according to the revised El Escorial criteria and the Awaji-criteria. Two categories of familial ALS (FALS) were used. A patient was defined FALS-A if at least 1 first- or second-degree family member had ALS, and FALS-NP, if family members had additional neurologic or psychiatric endophenotypes. Results Of the 815 patients, 25% had FALS-A and 45% FALS-NP. C9orf72 expansion (C9pos) was found in 256 (31%) of all patients, in 58% of FALS-A category, in 48% of FALS-NP category, and in 23 or 17% of sporadic cases using the FALS-A or FALS-NP definition. C9pos or SOD1 p.D91A homozygosity was found in 328 (40%) of the 815 patients. We compared demographic and clinical characteristics between C9pos and patients with unknown cause of ALS (Unk). We found that the age at onset was significantly earlier and survival markedly shorter in the C9pos vs Unk patients with ALS. The shortest survival was found in bulbar-onset male C9pos patients, whereas the longest survival was found in Unk limb-onset males. Older age at onset associated consistently with shorter survival in C9pos and Unk patients in both limb-onset and bulbar-onset groups. There were no significant differences in the frequencies of bulbar-onset and limb-onset patients in C9pos and Unk groups. ALS-frontotemporal dementia (FTD) was more common in C9pos (17%) than in Unk (4%) patients, and of all patients with ALS-FTD, 70% were C9pos. Discussion These results provide further evidence for the short survival of C9orf72-associated ALS. A prominent role of the C9orf72 and SOD1 variants was found in the Finnish population.

Objective: To evaluate the association between treatment with tofacitinib, tocilizumab, or TNF inhibitors compared with abatacept and risk of incident ADRD. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was conducted among US Medicare fee-for-service patients with rheumatoid arthritis aged 65 years and older from 2007 to 2017. Patients were categorized into 3 cohorts based on initiation of tofacitinib (a JAK inhibitor), tocilizumab (an IL-6 inhibitor), or TNF inhibitors compared with a common comparator abatacept (a T-cell activation inhibitor). Analyses were conducted from August 2020 to August 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was onset of ADRD based on diagnosis codes evaluated in 4 alternative analysis schemes: (1) an as-treated follow-up approach, (2) an as-started follow-up approach incorporating a 6-month induction period, (3) incorporating a 6-month symptom to diagnosis period to account for misclassification of ADRD onset, and (4) identifying ADRD through symptomatic prescriptions and diagnosis codes.

There are no large-scale studies testing associations between WMH and circulating metabolites. Methods: We studied up to 9290 individuals (50.7% female, average age 61 years) from 15 populations of 8 community-based cohorts. WMH volume was quantified from T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images or as hypointensities on T1-weighted images. Circulating metabolomic measures were assessed with mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Associations between WMH and metabolomic measures were tested by fitting linear regression models in the pooled sample and in sex-stratified and statin treatment-stratified subsamples. Our basic models were adjusted for age, sex, age×sex, and technical covariates, and our fully adjusted models were also adjusted for statin treatment, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, smoking, body mass index, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Population-specific results were meta-analyzed using the fixed-effect inverse variance-weighted method. Associations with false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P values (PFDR)<0.05 were considered significant. Results: In the meta-analysis of results from the basic models, we identified 30 metabolomic measures associated with WMH (PFDR<0.05), 7 of which remained significant in the fully adjusted models. The most significant association was with higher level of hydroxyphenylpyruvate in men (PFDR.full.adj=1.40×10-7) and in both the pooled sample (PFDR.full.adj=1.66×10-4) and statin-untreated (PFDR.full.adj=1.65×10-6) subsample. In men, hydroxyphenylpyruvate explained 3% to 14% of variance in WMH. In men and the pooled sample, WMH were also associated with lower levels of lysophosphatidylcholines and hydroxysphingomyelins and a larger diameter of low-density lipoprotein particles, likely arising from higher triglyceride to total lipids and lower cholesteryl ester to total lipids ratios within these particles. In women, the only significant association was with higher level of glucuronate (PFDR=0.047). Conclusions: Circulating metabolomic measures, including multiple lipid measures (eg, lysophosphatidylcholines, hydroxysphingomyelins, low-density lipoprotein size and composition) and nonlipid metabolites (eg, hydroxyphenylpyruvate, glucuronate), associate with WMH in a general population of middle-aged and older adults.

Methods: We performed muscle biopsies in 15 octogenarian world class track and field masters athletes (MA) and 14 non-athlete age/sex-matched controls (NA) to provide insights into mechanisms for preserving function in advanced age. Muscle samples were assessed for respiratory compromised fibers, mtDNA copy number, and proteomics by liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry. Results: MA exhibited markedly better performance on clinical function tests and greater cross-sectional area of the vastus lateralis muscle. Proteomics analysis revealed marked differences, where most of the ~800 differentially represented proteins in MA versus NA pertained to mitochondria structure/function such as electron transport capacity (ETC), cristae formation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and mtDNA-encoded proteins. In contrast, proteins from the spliceosome complex and nuclear pore were downregulated in MA. Consistent with proteomics data, MA had fewer respiratory compromised fibers, higher mtDNA copy number, and an increased protein ratio of the cristae-bound ETC subunits relative to the outer mitochondrial membrane protein voltage dependent anion channel. There was a substantial overlap of proteins overrepresented in MA versus NA with proteins that decline with aging and which are higher in physically active than sedentary individuals. However, we also found 176 proteins related to mitochondria that are uniquely differentially expressed in MA. Conclusions: We conclude that high function in advanced age is associated with preserving mitochondrial structure/function proteins, with under-representation of proteins involved in the spliceosome and nuclear pore complex. Whereas many of these differences in MA appear related to their physical activity habits, others may reflect unique biological (e.g., gene, environment) mechanisms that preserve muscle integrity and function with aging.

The mechanisms underlying this relationship are unknown. We hypothesize that individuals who experience dual decline may have specific pathophysiological pathways to dementia which can be indicated by specific metabolomic signatures. Here, we summarize blood-based metabolites that are associated with memory and gait from existing literature and discuss their relevant pathways. A total of 39 eligible studies were included in this systematic review. Metabolites that were associated with memory and gait belonged to five shared classes: sphingolipids, fatty acids, phosphatidylcholines, amino acids, and biogenic amines.

It is unknown whether energy decline, a predictor of mobility disability, is also associated with MPS. We hypothesized that those with MPS had greater decline in self-reported energy level (SEL) than those without MPS, and that SEL decline and MPS share neural substrates. Method: Using data from the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study, we analyzed 293 Parkinson's disease-free participants (83 ± 3 years old, 39% Black, 58% women) with neuroimaging data, MPS evaluation by Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale in 2006-2008, and ≥3 measures of SEL since 1999-2000. Individual SEL slopes were computed via linear mixed models. Associations of SEL slopes with MPS were tested using logistic regression models. Associations of SEL slope with volume of striatum, sensorimotor, and cognitive regions were examined using linear regression models adjusted for normalized total gray matter volume. Models were adjusted for baseline SEL, mobility, demographics, and comorbidities. Results: Compared to those without MPS (n = 165), those with MPS (n = 128) had 37% greater SEL decline in the prior 8 years (p =. 001). Greater SEL decline was associated with smaller right striatal volume (adjusted standardized β = 0.126, p =. 029). SEL decline was not associated with volumes in other regions.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This substudy of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) randomized clinical trial compared the efficacy of 2 different blood pressure-lowering strategies with longitudinal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including arterial spin labeled perfusion imaging to quantify CBF. A total of 1267 adults 50 years or older with hypertension and increased cardiovascular risk but free of diabetes or dementia were screened for the SPRINT substudy from 6 sites in the US. Randomization began in November 2010 with final follow-up MRI in July 2016. Analyses were performed from September 2020 through December 2021.

Methods: Participants (n=2662, mean age 74.6±4.8) from the longitudinal population-based AGES (Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility)-Reykjavik Study underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and on average 5.2 years later. We assessed the number and location of brain infarcts (prevalent versus incident). We estimated the risk-ratios of prevalent (PRR) and incident (IRR) infarcts by baseline cerebrovascular risk-factors using Poisson regression. Results: Thirty-one percent of the study participants had prevalent brain infarcts and 21% developed new infarcts over 5 years. Prevalent subcortical infarcts were associated with hypertension (PRR, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.1-6.8]), systolic blood pressure (PRR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.1-1.4]), and diabetes (PRR, 2.8 [95% CI, 1.9-4.1]); incident subcortical infarcts were associated with systolic (IRR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0-1.4]) and diastolic (IRR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.0-1.6]) blood pressure. Prevalent and incident cortical infarcts were associated with carotid plaques (PRR, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.3-2.5] and IRR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.3-2.9], respectively), and atrial fibrillation was significantly associated with prevalent cortical infarcts (PRR, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.2-2.7]).

Results: The proposed framework identifies fiber bundles with high agreement against tractography-based pathways with a median Dice coefficient from 0.62 to 0.87 on a test cohort, achieving improved subject-specific accuracy when compared to population atlas-based methods. We demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed framework on three externally available datasets. Conclusions: We show that patch-wise convolutional neural network can achieve robust bundle segmentation from T1w.

Gender disparities are striking in interventional cardiology (IC) and electrophysiology (EP) and in leadership. Left atrial appendage closure with the WATCHMAN device, as a novel procedure, is a lens into inequities. Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify the characteristics and prevalence of women (1) as early WATCHMAN implanters and (2) in related leadership. Methods: Data were collected on WATCHMAN implanters and hospitals from January 2017 to December 2018. The gender of physicians in leadership positions was identified via survey as Director of IC, Director of EP, and Chief of Cardiology. The Firth logistic model controlling for covariates modeled the rare event of a woman implanter. Results: Data were obtained for 100% of the cohort. Men comprised 97% of implanters (860/886). No differences in subspecialty or implants by gender were observed. There were 414 hospitals performing WATCHMAN: 24% academic, 97% urban, and most medium/large size (94%). EP made up 61% of implanters. Only 4.8% of hospitals had women in selected leadership roles. Women represented <1% of Directors of IC and only 2.6% of both Directors of EP and Chiefs of Cardiology. Hospitals with a woman in leadership had a 4 times greater odds of a woman implanter (odds ratio 4.24; 95% confidence interval 1.16–15.41; P = .028).

Despite the accepted tenet that F1Fo transports exclusively H+, our laboratory has demonstrated that, in addition to H+, F1Fo ATP synthase transports a significant fraction of ΔΨm-driven charge as K+ to synthesize ATP. Herein, we utilize a computational modeling approach as a proof of principle of the feasibility of the core mechanism underlying the enhanced ATP synthesis, and to explore its bioenergetic consequences. A minimal model comprising the ‘core’ mechanism constituted by ATP synthase, driven by both proton (PMF) and potassium motive force (KMF), respiratory chain, adenine nucleotide translocator, Pi carrier, and K+/H+ exchanger (KHEmito) was able to simulate enhanced ATP synthesis and respiratory fluxes determined experimentally with isolated heart mitochondria. This capacity of F1Fo ATP synthase confers mitochondria with a significant energetic advantage compared to K+ transport through a channel not linked to oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). The K+-cycling mechanism requires a KHEmito that exchanges matrix K+ for intermembrane space H+, leaving PMF as the overall driving energy of OxPhos, in full agreement with the standard chemiosmotic mechanism. Experimental data of state 4➔3 energetic transitions, mimicking low to high energy demand, could be reproduced by an integrated computational model of mitochondrial function that incorporates the ‘core’ mechanism. Model simulations display similar behavior compared to the experimentally observed changes in ΔΨm, mitochondrial K+ uptake, matrix volume, respiration, and ATP synthesis during the energetic transitions at physiological pH and K+ concentration. The model also explores the role played by KHEmito in modulating the energetic performance of mitochondria.

However, the cellular mechanisms underlying CB2R action remain unclear. We have previously reported that cocaine self-administration upregulates CB2R expression in midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons. In the present study, we investigated whether cocaine or heroin also alters CB2R expression in striatal medium-spiny neurons that express dopamine D1 or D2 receptors (D1-MSNs, D2-MSNs) and microglia. Due to the concern of CB2R antibody specificity, we developed three mouse CB2-specific probes to detect CB2R mRNA using quantitative RT-PCR and RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) assays. We found that a single injection of cocaine failed to alter, while repeated cocaine injections or self-administration dose-dependently upregulated CB2R gene expression in both brain (cortex and striatum) and periphery (spleen). In contrast, repeated administration of heroin produced a dose-dependent reduction in striatal CB2 mRNA expression. RNAscope ISH assays detected CB2R mRNA in striatal D1- and D2-MSNs, not in microglia. We then used transgenic CX3CR1eGFP/+ microglia reporter mice and D1- or D2-Cre-RiboTag mice to purify striatal microglia or ribosome-associated mRNAs from CX3CR1eGFP/+, D1-MSNs, or D2-MSNs, respectively. We found that CB2R upregulation occurred mainly in D1-MSNs, not in D2-MSNs or microglia, in the nucleus accumbens rather than the dorsal striatum. These findings indicate that repeated cocaine exposure may upregulate CB2R expression in both brain and spleen, with regional and cell type-specific profiles. In the striatum, CB2R upregulation occurs mainly in D1-MSNs in the nucleus accumbens.

Despite most prior research focusing on self-regulation as an individual-level trait, we hypothesize that self-regulation is a time-varying mechanism of health and risk behavior that may be influenced by momentary contexts to a substantial degree. Because most health behaviors (e.g., eating, drinking, smoking) occur in the context of everyday activities, digital technologies may help us better understand and influence these behaviors in real time. Using a momentary self-regulation measure, the current study (which was part of a larger multi-year research project on the science of behavior change) used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to assess if self-regulation can be engaged and manipulated on a momentary basis in naturalistic, non-laboratory settings. Methods: This one-arm, open-label exploratory study prospectively collected momentary data for 14 days from 104 participants who smoked regularly and 81 participants who were overweight and had binge-eating disorder. Four times per day, participants were queried about momentary self-regulation, emotional state, and social and environmental context; recent smoking and exposure to smoking cues (smoking sample only); and recent eating, binge eating, and exposure to binge-eating cues (binge-eating sample only). This study used a novel, momentary self-regulation measure comprised of four subscales: momentary perseverance, momentary sensation seeking, momentary self-judgment, and momentary mindfulness. Participants were also instructed to engage with Laddr, a mobile application that provides evidence-based health behavior change tools via an integrated platform. The association between momentary context and momentary self-regulation was explored via mixed-effects models. Exploratory assessments of whether recent Laddr use (defined as use within 12 h of momentary responses) modified the association between momentary context and momentary self-regulation were performed via mixed-effects models. Results: Participants (mean age 35.2; 78% female) in the smoking and binge-eating samples contributed a total of 3,233 and 3,481 momentary questionnaires, respectively. Momentary self-regulation subscales were associated with several momentary contexts, in the combined as well as smoking and binge-eating samples. For example, in the combined sample momentary perseverance was associated with location, positively associated with positive affect, and negatively associated with negative affect, stress, and tiredness. In the smoking sample, momentary perseverance was positively associated with momentary difficulty in accessing cigarettes, caffeine intake, and momentary restraint in smoking, and negatively associated with temptation and urge to smoke. In the binge-eating sample, momentary perseverance was positively associated with difficulty in accessing food and restraint in eating, and negatively associated with urge to binge eat. While recent Laddr use was not associated directly with momentary self-regulation subscales, it did modify several of the contextual associations, including challenging contexts. Conclusions: Overall, this study provides preliminary evidence that momentary self-regulation may vary in response to differing momentary contexts in samples from two exemplar populations with risk behaviors. In addition, the Laddr application may modify some of these relationships. These findings demonstrate the possibility of measuring momentary self-regulation in a trans-diagnostic way and assessing the effects of momentary, mobile interventions in context. Health behavior change interventions may consider measuring and targeting momentary self-regulation in addition to trait-level self-regulation to better understand and improve health risk behaviors. This work will be used to inform a later stage of research focused on assessing the transdiagnostic mediating effect of momentary self-regulation on medical regimen adherence and health outcomes.

Whether ABI decline is associated with greater declines in thigh muscle oxidative capacity with aging is unknown. METHOD AND RESULTS: We analyzed data from 228 participants (100 men) of the BLSA (Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging), aged 39 to 97 years, with an ABI between 0.9 and 1.40 at baseline and at follow-up (mean follow-up period of 2.8 years). We examined mitochondrial oxidative capacity of the left thigh muscle, by measuring the postexercise phosphocreatine recovery rate constant (kPCr) from phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Greater kPCr indicated higher mitochondrial oxidative capacity. Although kPCr was available on the left leg only, ABI was measured in both legs. Longitudinal rates of change (Change) of left and right ABI and kPCr of the left thigh muscle were estimated using linear mixed effects models, and their association was analyzed by standardized multiple linear regressions. In multivariate analysis including sex, age, baseline kPCr, both left and right baseline ABI, and ABI change in both legs, (kPCr)Change was directly associated with ipsilateral (left) (ABI)Change (standardized [STD]-β=0.14; P=0.0168) but not with contralateral (right) (ABI)Change (P=0.22).

Little is known about trajectories of BP that modulate this risk. Objective: To identify BP trajectory patterns from young adulthood to midlife that are associated with brain structure in midlife. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data of US adults from Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA), a prospective longitudinal study of Black and White men and women (baseline age 18 to 30 years) examined up to 8 times over 30 years (1985-1986 to 2015-2016). There were 885 participants who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 25th or 30th year examinations. Analyses were conducted November 2019 to December 2020. Exposures: Using group-based trajectory modeling, 5 25-year BP trajectories for 3 BP traits were identified in the total CARDIA cohort of participants with 3 or more BP measures, which were then applied to analyses of the subset of 853 participants in the Brain MRI substudy. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was examined as an integrative measure of systolic and diastolic BP. With linear regression, the associations of the BP trajectories with brain structures were examined, adjusting sequentially for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and antihypertensive medication use. Main Outcomes and Measures: Brain MRI outcomes include total brain, total gray matter, normal-looking and abnormal white matter volumes, gray matter cerebral blood flow, and white matter fractional anisotropy. Results: Brain MRI analyses were conducted on 853 participants (mean [SD] age, 50.3 [3.6] years; 399 [46.8%] men; 354 [41.5%] Black and 499 [58.5%] White individuals). The MAP trajectory distribution was 187 individuals (21.1%) with low-stable, 385 (43.5%) with moderate-gradual, 71 (8.0%) with moderate-increasing, 204 (23.1%) with elevated-stable, and 38 (4.3%) with elevated-increasing. Compared with the MAP low-stable trajectory group, individuals in the moderate-increasing and elevated-increasing groups were more likely to have higher abnormal white matter volume (moderate: β, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.82; elevated: β, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.95). Those in the MAP elevated-increasing group had lower gray matter cerebral blood flow (β, -0.42; 95% CI, -0.79 to -0.05) after adjusting for sociodemographics and cardiovascular risk factors. After adjustment for antihypertensive medication use, the difference was consistent for abnormal white matter volume, but results were no longer significant for gray matter cerebral blood flow.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of PLIUS in providing symptom reduction and decreased loss of tibiofemoral cartilage thickness in patients with knee OA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A phase 2A, sham-controlled, parallel, double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted at 2 Veterans Affairs hospitals in Salt Lake City, Utah, and San Diego, California, from May 22, 2015, to January 31, 2019. Data were analyzed from June 27, 2020, to October 20, 2020. Participants recruited through the US Department of Veterans Affairs (N = 132) with clinical and radiographic evidence of early knee OA were randomly assigned to receive PLIUS or a sham device, self-administered for 20 minutes daily over the medial compartment of the knee. All enrollees participated in a 4-week prerandomization sham run-in period, followed by a 48-week treatment period. Randomization was stratified by study site and Kellgren-Lawrence grades 1 (n = 15), 2 (n = 51), and 3 (n = 66). INTERVENTION Participants either received 48 weeks of PLIUS or sham ultrasonography. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The trial incorporated 2 coprimary outcomes: symptomatic improvement assessed by Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials-Osteoarthritis Research Society International Responder Criteria (ie, met if either >50% improvement in pain and function with at least a 20% absolute improvement of at least 2 of the following 3 factors: improvement by at least 20% [pain, function, and patient global assessment] with at least a 10-mm absolute improvement), and cartilage preservation assessed as change in central medial femoral condyle cartilage thickness by magnetic resonance imaging. Intention-to-treat analysis was used. RESULTS The mean (SD) participant age was 63.6 (10.7) years and 119 were men (90.2%). The mean (SD) duration of OA symptoms was 13.4 (12.3) years. In the PLIUS group, 70.4% (95% CI, 58.2%-82.6%) of the participants experienced symptomatic improvement, compared with 67.3% (95% CI, 54.9%-79.7%) of participants in the sham group (P = .84); there was no statistically significant difference in response rates between the treatment groups, and the between-group rate difference of 3.1% (95% CI, -14.3% to 20.5%) did not meet the predefined 10% threshold for clinically significant symptomatic improvement from application of PLIUS. At 48 weeks of treatment, central medial femoral condyle cartilage thickness decreased by a mean (SD) of 73.8 (168.1) μm in the PLIUS group and by 42.2 (297.0) μm in the sham group. This 48-week mean change between the 2 groups did not reach statistical significance (P = .44), and the between-group 48-week difference of -31.7 μm (95% CI, -129.0 μm to 65.7 μm) did not meet the predefined threshold.

We have previously used longitudinal assessment of TSH and free thyroxine (FT4) to distinguish primary and secondary changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, an approach which is impractical for clinical diagnosis. Objective: Identify contemporaneous clinical tests and criteria that predict the longitudinally-derived HPT axis phenotype in those with isolated elevated TSH. Methods: Using data from Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, participants with over three years of follow up not on thyroid hormone replacement, with a TSH above the reference range and an in-range FT4 at the current visit, and at least 1% per year increase in TSH (mean 6.9% annual increase; n=72), we examined correlations between various clinical factors and the change in FT4 across the phenotypic range from emerging hypothyroidism, with falling FT4, to adaptive stress-response, with rising FT4. Results: Current FT4 level, but not TSH, Free T3, anti-TPO antibody status, age or sex, was significantly associated with phenotype, determined by the annual rate of change in FT4 in those with elevated and rising TSH, both as a continuous variable (β=0.07 per ng/dL increase in FT4; p<0.001) and in quartiles (p<0.001). We estimated a threshold for FT4 of less than 0.89 ng/dL (11.45 pmol/L; the 24th percentile of the reference range), as predictive of a phenotype in the first quartile, consistent with subclinical hypothyroidism, while a FT3:FT4 ratio below 2.77 predicted a phenotype in the fourth quartile, more consistent with adaptive stress-response.

The association between vitamin D metabolites namely 1,25(OH)D, 25(OH)D, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and BPA levels were evaluated. Multiple regression models were used to examine the association between predictor variables with 1,25(OH)D or 25(OH)D levels.

In previous work, we investigated the genetic basis of this heterogeneity by clustering 94 T2D genetic loci using their associations with 47 diabetes-related traits and identified five clusters, termed b-cell, proinsulin, obesity, lipodystro-phy, and liver/lipid. The relationship between these clusters and individual-level metabolic disease outcomes has not been assessed. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Here we constructed individual-level partitioned polygenic scores (pPS) for these five clusters in 12 studies from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium and the UK Biobank (n = 454,193) and tested for cross-sectional association with T2D-related outcomes, including blood pressure, renal function, insulin use, age at T2D diagnosis, and coronary artery disease (CAD). RESULTS Despite all clusters containing T2D risk-increasing alleles, they had differential associations with metabolic outcomes. Increased obesity and lipodystrophy cluster pPS, which had opposite directions of association with measures of adiposity, were both significantly associated with increased blood pressure and hyperten-sion. The lipodystrophy and liver/lipid cluster pPS were each associated with CAD, with increasing and decreasing effects, respectively. An increased liver/lipid cluster pPS was also significantly associated with reduced renal function. The liver/lipid cluster includes known loci linked to liver lipid metabolism (e.g., GCKR, PNPLA3, and TM6SF2), and these findings suggest that cardiovascular disease risk and renal function may be impacted by these loci through their shared disease pathway.

Results: MIND score was inversely associated with physical function impairment (per 1-point increment: OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.93; P < 0.01), and with each SPPB component, over a median 6 y of follow-up.

We investigated whether subclinical hearing loss (SCHL) or imperfect hearing traditionally categorized as normal (pure-tone average ≤25 dB) may be similarly linked to cognitive decline and risk of incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/dementia. Methods: Participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging were cognitively normal adults at least 50 years old with cognitive assessments from 1991 to 2019 and pure-tone average ≤25 dB measured between 1991 and 1994 (n = 263). The exposure was hearing based on the better ear pure-tone average. Outcomes were test scores in various cognitive domains. Multivariable linear-mixed effects models were developed to analyze the association between hearing and change in cognition over time, adjusting for age, sex, education, vascular burden, and race. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards models portrayed associations between hearing and incident MCI/dementia diagnosis based on predefined criteria. Results: Of 263 participants, 145 (55.1%) were female; mean age was 68.3 years (SD = 8.9). Follow-up ranged up to 27.7 years (mean = 11.7 years). Adjusting for multiple comparisons, a 10-dB increase in hearing loss was associated with an annual decline of -0.02 SD (95% confidence interval: -0.03, -0.01) in Letter Fluency.

We studied a prospective cohort of 3343 individuals from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, aged 44-65 years at baseline with up to 30 years of follow-up. Methods: Hearing was assessed in late life (2016-2017) using a better-ear audiometric pure tone average (0.5, 1, 2, 4 kHz) and the Quick Speech-in-Noise (QuickSIN) test. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg, or antihypertensive medication use. Midlife hypertension was defined by hypertension at 2 consecutive visits between 1987-1989 and 1996-1998. Late-life hypertension was defined in 2016-2017. Late-life low blood pressure was defined as a systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure less than 60 mmHg, irrespective of antihypertensive medication use. Associations between blood pressure patterns from mid- to late life and hearing outcomes were assessed using multivariable-adjusted linear regression. Results: Compared to persistent normotension, persistent hypertension from mid- to late life was associated with worse central auditory processing (difference in QuickSIN score = -0.66 points, 95% CI: -1.14, -0.17) but not with audiometric hearing.

Consistent with expectations from a long history of neuropsychological research, DNMS performance in young animals prominently correlated with the volume of multiple structures in the medial temporal lobe memory system. Less anticipated correlations were also observed in the cingulate and cerebellum. In aged monkeys, significant volumetric correlations with DNMS performance were largely restricted to the prefrontal cortex and striatum. Importantly, interaction effects in an omnibus analysis directly confirmed that the associations between volume and task performance in the MTL and prefrontal cortex are age-dependent.

Biochemical analysis of the mutant RECQL1 protein revealed that the p.A459S missense mutation compromised its ATPase, helicase, and fork restoration activity, while its capacity to promote single-strand DNA annealing was largely unaffected. At the cellular level, this mutation in RECQL1 gave rise to a defect in the ability to repair DNA damage induced by exposure to topoisomerase poisons and a failure of DNA replication to progress efficiently in the presence of abortive topoisomerase lesions.

We aimed to determine the association between number of steps per day and stepping rate with all-cause mortality. Methods: In this meta-analysis, we identified studies investigating the effect of daily step count on all-cause mortality in adults (aged ≥18 years), via a previously published systematic review and expert knowledge of the field. We asked participating study investigators to process their participant-level data following a standardised protocol. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality collected from death certificates and country registries. We analysed the dose–response association of steps per day and stepping rate with all-cause mortality. We did Cox proportional hazards regression analyses using study-specific quartiles of steps per day and calculated hazard ratios (HRs) with inverse-variance weighted random effects models. Findings: We identified 15 studies, of which seven were published and eight were unpublished, with study start dates between 1999 and 2018. The total sample included 47 471 adults, among whom there were 3013 deaths (10·1 per 1000 participant-years) over a median follow-up of 7·1 years ([IQR 4·3–9·9]; total sum of follow-up across studies was 297 837 person-years). Quartile median steps per day were 3553 for quartile 1, 5801 for quartile 2, 7842 for quartile 3, and 10 901 for quartile 4. Compared with the lowest quartile, the adjusted HR for all-cause mortality was 0·60 (95% CI 0·51–0·71) for quartile 2, 0·55 (0·49–0·62) for quartile 3, and 0·47 (0·39–0·57) for quartile 4. Restricted cubic splines showed progressively decreasing risk of mortality among adults aged 60 years and older with increasing number of steps per day until 6000–8000 steps per day and among adults younger than 60 years until 8000–10 000 steps per day. Adjusting for number of steps per day, comparing quartile 1 with quartile 4, the association between higher stepping rates and mortality was attenuated but remained significant for a peak of 30 min (HR 0·67 [95% CI 0·56–0·83]) and a peak of 60 min (0·67 [0·50–0·90]), but not significant for time (min per day) spent walking at 40 steps per min or faster (1·12 [0·96–1·32]) and 100 steps per min or faster (0·86 [0·58–1·28]). Interpretation: Taking more steps per day was associated with a progressively lower risk of all-cause mortality, up to a level that varied by age.

We further showed that metformin enhanced expression of lgg-1, daf-16, skn-1 and other genes known to regulate autophagy, longevity and oxidative stress in hSOD1 transgenic worms. Accordingly, overexpression of lgg-1 or daf-16 attenuated the aging and pathological abnormalities of mutant human SOD1 worms, while genetic deletion of lgg-1 or daf-16 abolished the beneficial effects of metformin.

However, while the impact of exposure to AhR ligands is well studied in the peripheral immune system, the impact of such exposure on immune function in the brain is less well defined. Microglia serve dual roles in providing synaptic and immunological support for neighboring neurons and in mediating responses to environmental stimuli, including exposure to environmental chemicals. Because of their dual roles in regulating physiological and pathological processes, cortical microglia are well positioned to translate toxic stimuli into defects in cortical function via aberrant synaptic and immunological functioning, mediated either through direct microglial AhR activation or in response to AhR activation in neighboring cells. Here, we use gene expression studies, histology, and two-photon in vivo imaging to investigate how developmental exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a high-affinity and persistent AhR agonist, modulates microglial characteristics and function in the intact brain. Whole cortical RT-qPCR analysis and RNA-sequencing of isolated microglia revealed that gestational and lactational TCDD exposure produced subtle, but durable, changes in microglia transcripts. Histological examination and two-photon in vivo imaging revealed that while microglia density, distribution, morphology, and motility were unaffected by TCDD exposure, exposure resulted in microglia that responded more robustly to focal tissue injury. However, this effect was rectified with depletion and repopulation of microglia. These results suggest that gestational and lactational exposure to AhR ligands can result in long-term priming of microglia to produce heightened responses towards tissue injury which can be restored to normal function through microglial repopulation.",6,Journal,ar,Article,100,8,8,NA,20695,NIH,K12 GM106997,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,362,08891591,288-303,35065196,Aryl hydrocarbon receptor | Dioxin | Gene expression | Microglia | RNA-sequencing | Two-photon microscopy | Visual cortex,S0889159122000162

Purpose: To develop and evaluate a deep learning-based image harmonization method to improve cross-site generalizability of deep learning age prediction. Study Type: Retrospective. Population: Eight thousand eight hundred and seventy-six subjects from six sites. Harmonization models were trained using all subjects. Age prediction models were trained using 2739 subjects from a single site and tested using the remaining 6137 subjects from various other sites. Field Strength/Sequence: Brain imaging with magnetization prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo or spoiled gradient echo sequences at 1.5 T and 3 T. Assessment: StarGAN v2, was used to perform a canonical mapping from diverse datasets to a reference domain to reduce site-based variation while preserving semantic information. Generalization performance of deep learning age prediction was evaluated using harmonized, histogram matched, and unharmonized data.

Participants with DSM-IV TR BD I or II with hypomanic or depressive symptoms were randomized, stratified on gender (N = 82). The intervention included the provision of group-specific study foods and dietary counseling. Variability of mood symptoms was measured by a twice-daily, 12-week ecological momentary analysis (EMA) paradigm, and group differences were analyzed using multilevel models. Circulating n-3 and n-6 fatty acids were measured at baseline and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of diet exposure. Results: All 82 randomized participants were included in biochemical analyses. Seventy participants completed at least 2 EMA surveys and were included in primary EMA analyses. Variability in mood, energy, irritability, and pain as measured using EMA was reduced in the H3-L6 group compared to the CD group. No significant differences in mean ratings of mood symptoms, or any other symptom measures, were detected. The dietary intervention effect on target PUFAs significantly differed by the group over time. Conclusions: A dietary intervention adjunctive to usual care showed preliminary efficacy in improving variability in mood symptoms in participants with BD.

This may bias the study and consequently a meta-analysis (MA) estimate. These estimates may differ across statistical methods used to deal with this issue. Analysis of individual participant data (IPD) allows standardization of methods across studies. We aimed to identify methods used in published IPD-MAs of NRSs for continuous outcomes, and to compare different methods to account for baseline values of outcome variables in IPD-MA of NRSs using two empirical examples from the Thyroid Studies Collaboration (TSC). Methods: For the first aim we systematically searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane from inception to February 2021 to identify published IPD-MAs of NRSs that adjusted for baseline outcome measures in the analysis of continuous outcomes. For the second aim, we applied analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), change score, propensity score and the naïve approach (ignores the baseline outcome data) in IPD-MA from NRSs on the association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and depressive symptoms and renal function. We estimated the study and meta-analytic mean difference (MD) and relative standard error (SE). We used both fixed- and random-effects MA. Results: Ten of 18 (56%) of the included studies used the change score method, seven (39%) studies used ANCOVA and one the propensity score (5%). The study estimates were similar across the methods in studies in which groups were balanced at baseline with regard to outcome variables but differed in studies with baseline imbalance. In our empirical examples, ANCOVA and change score showed study results on the same direction, not the propensity score. In our applications, ANCOVA provided more precise estimates, both at study and meta-analytical level, in comparison to other methods. Heterogeneity was higher when change score was used as outcome, moderate for ANCOVA and null with the propensity score. Conclusion: ANCOVA provided the most precise estimates at both study and meta-analytic level and thus seems preferable in the meta-analysis of IPD from non-randomized studies.

We assessed the pharmacokinetic profiles of all 12 HNKs in the plasma and brains of male and female mice and compared the relative potencies of four (2,6)-HNKs to induce antidepressant-relevant behavioral effects in the forced swim test in male mice. While all HNKs were readily brain-penetrable following intraperitoneal injection, there were robust differences in peak plasma and brain concentrations and exposures. Forced swim test immobility rank order of potency, from most to least potent, was (2R,6S)-, (2S,6R)-, (2R,6R)-, and (2S,6S)-HNK. We hypothesized that distinct structure-activity relationships and the resulting potency of each metabolite are linked to unique substitution patterns and resultant conformation of the six-membered cyclohexanone ring system. To explore this, we synthesized (5R)-methyl-(2R,6R)-HNK, which incorporates a methyl substitution on the cyclohexanone ring. (5R)-Methyl-(2R,6R)-HNK exhibited similar antidepressant-like potency to (2R,6S)-HNK.

Specifically, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indices, sensitive measures of myelin and axonal density in WM, and myelin water fraction (MWF), a measure of the fraction of the signal of water trapped within the myelin sheets, to probe these differences. Furthermore, we examined regional correlations between MWF and DTI indices to evaluate whether the DTI metrics provide information complementary to MWF. While sexual dimorphism was, overall, nonsignificant, we observed region-dependent differences in MWF, that is, myelin content, and axonal density with age and found that both exhibit nonlinear, but distinct, associations with age. Furthermore, DTI indices were moderately correlated with MWF, indicating their good sensitivity to myelin content as well as to other constituents of WM tissue such as axonal density. The microstructural differences captured by our MRI metrics, along with their weak to moderate associations with MWF, strongly indicate the potential value of combining these outcome measures in a multiparametric approach. Furthermore, our results support the last-in-first-out and the gain-predicts-loss hypotheses of WM maturation and degeneration.

Methods: Participants from the BLSA (Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging) completed the Revised NEO Personality Inventory and underwent amyloid (11C-labeled Pittsburgh compound B) and tau (18F-flortaucipir) positron emission tomography. Results: Among cognitively normal BLSA participants, neuroticism was associated with higher cortical amyloid burden (odds ratio 1.68, 95% CI 1.20–2.34), and conscientiousness was associated with lower cortical amyloid burden (odds ratio 0.61, 95% CI 0.44–0.86).

The associations were moderated by cognitive status, with stronger effects in cognitively normal compared with heterogeneous samples, suggesting that the associations between personality and proteopathies are not phenomena that emerge with neuropsychiatric clinical symptoms.

Ongoing research to develop AD treatments has characterized multiple drug targets including the cholinergic system, amyloid-β peptide, phosphorylated tau, and neuroinflammation. These systems have the potential to interact to either drive or slow AD progression. Promising agents that simultaneously impact many of these drug targets are the AD experimental drug Posiphen and its enantiomer phenserine that, currently, are separately being evaluated in clinical trials. To define the cholinergic component of these agents, the anticholinesterase activities of a ligand dataset comprising Posiphen and primary metabolites ((+)-N1-norPosiphen, (+)-N8-norPosiphen, and (+)-N1,N8-bisnorPosiphen) were characterized and compared to those of the enantiomer phenserine. The “target” dataset involved the human cholinesterase enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Binding interactions between the ligands and targets were analyzed using Autodock 4.2. The computationally determined inhibitory action of these ligands was then compared to ex vivo laboratory-measured values versus human AChE and BChE. While Posiphen lacked AChE inhibitory action, its major and minor metabolites (+)-N1-norPosiphen and (+)-N1,N8-bisnorPosiphen, respectively, possessed modest AChE inhibitory activity, and Posiphen and all metabolites lacked BChE action. Phenserine, as a positive control, demonstrated AChE-selective inhibitory action. In light of AChE inhibitory action deriving from a major and minor Posiphen metabolite, current Posiphen clinical trials in AD and related disorders should additionally evaluate AChE inhibition; particularly if Posiphen should be combined with a known anticholinesterase, since this drug class is clinically approved and the standard of care for AD subjects, and excessive AChE inhibition may impact drug tolerability.",10,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,NA,21101018849,NIH,AG 000311,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,376,NA,70-79,NA,(+)-N1 | (+)-N1-norPosiphen | (+)-N8-norPosiphen | acetylcholinesterase | Alzheimer’s disease | butyrylcholinesterase | cholinesterase inhibitors | molecular docking | N8-bisnorPosiphen | phenserine | Posiphen,NA

Results showed that both male and female adolescent DAT-Cnr2 mice displayed significant increases in distance traveled in the OF test compared with WT mice. However, 2 mg/kg dose of amphetamine reduced the distance traveled by the DAT-Cnr2 but was increased in the WT mice. In the EPM test of anxiety-like behavioral responses, DAT-Cnr2 spent more time in the open arms of the maze than the WT mice, suggesting a reduction in anxiety-like response. DAT-Cnr2 mice showed significant increase in the number of unprotected head dips in the maze test and in the cliff avoidance reaction (CAR) test demonstrating impulsivity and risky behavior. DAT-Cnr2 mice also exhibited deficient response in the delay decision making (DDM), with impulsive choice. Both DAT-Cnr2 and WT were able to recognize the new object in the NOR task, but the exploration by the DAT-Cnr2 was less than that of the WT mice. Following the administration of 2 mg/kg of amphetamine, the similarities and differential performances of the DAT-Cnr2 and WT mice in the EPM test and NOR task was probably due to increase in attention.

Few studies have investigated gut microbiota and cognition in large community samples. OBJECTIVE To examine associations of gut microbial composition with measures of cognition in an established population-based study of middle-aged adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study analyzed data from the prospective Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort in 4 US metropolitan centers between 2015 and 2016. Data were analyzed in 2019 and 2020. EXPOSURES Stool DNA were sequenced, and the following gut microbial measures were gathered: (1) β-diversity (between-person) derived with multivariate principal coordinates analysis; (2) α-diversity (within-person), defined as richness (genera count) and the Shannon index (integrative measure of genera richness and evenness); and (3) taxonomy (107 genera, after filtering). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cognitive status was assessed using 6 clinic-administered cognitive tests: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Rey-Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Stroop, category fluency, and letter fluency. A global score measure derived using principal components analysis was also assessed; the first principal component explained 56% of variability. RESULTS Microbiome data were available on 597 CARDIA participants; mean (SD) age was 55.2 (3.5) years, 268 participants (44.7%) were men, and 270 (45.2%) were Black. In multivariable-adjusted principal coordinates analysis, permutational multivariate analysis of variance tests for β-diversity were statistically significant for all cognition measures (principal component analysis, P = .001; MoCA, P = .001; DSST, P = .001; RAVLT, P = .001; Stroop, P = .007; category fluency, P = .001) with the exception of letter fluency (P = .07). After adjusting for sociodemographic variables (age, race, sex, education), health behaviors (physical activity, diet, smoking, medication use), and clinical covariates (body mass index, diabetes, hypertension), Barnesiella was positively associated with the first principal component (β, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.08-0.24), DSST (β, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.35-2.00), and category fluency (β, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.31-0.87); Lachnospiraceae FCS020 group was positively associated with DSST (β, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.10-4.23), and Sutterella was negatively associated with MoCA (β, −0.27; 95% CI, −0.44 to −0.11). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cross-sectional study, microbial community composition, based on β-diversity, was associated with all cognitive measures in multivariable-adjusted analysis.

People with advanced kidney diseases may have poor olfaction. However, it is unclear whether poor olfaction is a marker for declining renal function or future risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We therefore investigated olfaction in relation to kidney function and risk of CKD. Methods These secondary data analyses were limited to participants of the year 3 clinical visit of the Health Aging and Body Composition Study. The analytic sample size varied between 1427 to 2531, depending on participant eligibility and data availability for each analysis. Olfaction was tested using the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT), defined as anosmia (score≤6), hyposmia (7–8), moderate (9–10), and good function (10–11) at baseline. We estimated glomerular filter rate (eGFR) at baseline and seven years later using the CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C equation, and defined incident CKD as eGFR<60 ml/min/1.73m2 and eGFR decline ≥1 ml/min/1.73m2/year. Further, we identified CKD hospitalization events from hospitalization and death records. We used inverse probability weighting and weighted multivariable regressions to account for censoring in the prospective analyses and used absolute risk regression to account for competing risk of death. Results At baseline, compared to participants with good olfaction, the multivariable-adjusted mean eGFR was 3.00 ml/min/1.73m2 lower (95% confidence interval (CI): -5.25, -0.75) for those with anosmia and 1.87 lower (95% CI: -3.94, 0.21) for those with hyposmia with a P for linear trend < 0.001. Those with anosmia at baseline was had a significantly lower eGFR seven years later (-5.31, 95% CI: -8.58, -2.04, P for trend = 0.002), but the association was attenuated after further accounting for baseline eGFR (-2.37, 95%CI: -4.91, 0.16, P for linear trend = 0.147). Olfactory function was not associated with incident CKD or CKD hospitalization. Conclusion In older adults > age 70 years, poor olfaction is associated with lower kidney function, but not future CKD risk.

We tested whether NfL may be linked to cardiometabolic risk factors, including BMI, the allostatic load (AL) total score (ALtotal), and related AL continuous components (ALcomp). We also tested whether these relations may differ by sex or by race. Methods: We used data from the HANDLS (Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span) study [n = 608, age at visit 1 (v1: 2004-2009): 30-66 y, 42% male, 58% African American] to investigate associations of initial cardiometabolic risk factors and time-dependent plasma NfL concentrations over 3 visits (2004-2017; mean ± SD follow-up time: 7.72 ± 1.28 y), with outcomes being NfLv1 and annualized change in NfL (δNfL). We used mixed-effects linear regression and structural equations modeling (SM). Results: BMI was associated with lower initial (γ01 =-0.014 ± 0.002, P < 0.001) but faster increase in plasma NfL over time (γ11 = +0.0012 ± 0.0003, P < 0.001), a pattern replicated for ALtotal. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), serum total cholesterol, and resting heart rate at v1 were linked with faster plasma NfL increase over time, overall, while being uncorrelated with NfLv1 (e.g., hsCRP × Time, full model: γ11 = +0.004 ± 0.002, P = 0.015). In SM analyses, BMI's association with δNfL was significantly mediated through ALtotal among women [total effect (TE) = +0.0014 ± 0.00038, P < 0.001; indirect effect = +0.00042 ± 0.00019, P = 0.025; mediation proportion = 30%], with only a direct effect (DE) detected among African American adults (TE = +0.0011 ± 0.0004, P = 0.015; DE = +0.0010 ± 0.00048, P = 0.034). The positive associations between ALtotal/BMI and δNfL were mediated through increased glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) concentrations, overall.

The mechanisms underpinning HNO anti-ischemic effects remain poorly understood. Using isolated perfused rat hearts subjected to 30 min global ischemia/1 or 2 h reperfusion, here we tested whether, in analogy to NO., HNO protection requires PKCε translocation to mitochondria and KATP channels activation. To this end, we compared the benefits afforded by ischemic preconditioning (IPC; 3 cycles of I/R) with those eventually granted by the NO. donor, diethylamine/NO, DEA/NO, and two chemically unrelated HNO donors: Angeli’s salt (AS, a prototypic donor) and isopropyla-mine/NO (IPA/NO, a new HNO releaser). All donors were given for 19 min before I/R injury. In control I/R hearts (1 h reperfusion), infarct size (IS) measured via tetrazolium salt staining was 66 ± 5.5% of the area at risk. Both AS and IPA/NO were as effective as IPC in reducing IS [30.7 ± 2.2 (AS), 31 ± 2.9 (IPA/NO), and 31 ± 0.8 (IPC), respectively)], whereas DEA/NO was significantly less so (36.2 ± 2.6%, p < 0.001 vs. AS, IPA/NO, or IPC). IPA/NO protection was still present after 120 min of reperfusion, and the co-infusion with the PKCε inhibitor (PKCV1-2500 nM) prevented it (IS = 30 ± 0.5 vs. 61 ± 1.8% with IPA/NO alone, p < 0.01). Irrespective of the donor, HNO anti-ischemic effects were insensitive to the KATP channel inhibitor, 5-OH decanoate (5HD, 100 μM), that, in contrast, abrogated DEA/NO protection. Finally, both HNO donors markedly enhanced the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) ROS threshold over control levels (≅35–40%), an action again insensitive to 5HD.

Air quality (AQ) improvement has been associated with improved cardiopulmonary health and decreased mortality, but to the best of our knowledge, no studies have examined the association with cognitive function. We examined whether AQ improvement was associated with slower rate of cognitive decline in older women aged 74 to 92 years. Methods and findings We studied a cohort of 2,232 women residing in the 48 contiguous US states that were recruited from more than 40 study sites located in 24 states and Washington, DC from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Memory Study (WHIMS)-Epidemiology of Cognitive Health Outcomes (WHIMS-ECHO) study. They were predominantly non-Hispanic White women and were dementia free at baseline in 2008 to 2012. Measures of annual (2008 to 2018) cognitive function included the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICSm) and the telephone-based California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). We used regionalized universal kriging models to estimate annual concentrations (1996 to 2012) of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at residential locations. Estimates were aggregated to the 3-year average immediately preceding (recent exposure) and 10 years prior to (remote exposure) WHIMS-ECHO enrollment. Individual-level improved AQ was calculated as the reduction from remote to recent exposures. Linear mixed effect models were used to examine the associations between improved AQ and the rates of cognitive declines in TICSm and CVLT trajectories, adjusting for sociodemographic (age; geographic region; race/ethnicity; education; income; and employment), lifestyle (physical activity; smoking; and alcohol), and clinical characteristics (prior hormone use; hormone therapy assignment; depression; cardiovascular disease (CVD); hypercholesterolemia; hypertension; diabetes; and body mass index [BMI]). For both PM2.5 and NO2, AQ improved significantly over the 10 years before WHIMS-ECHO enrollment. During a median of 6.2 (interquartile range [IQR] = 5.0) years of follow-up, declines in both general cognitive status (β = −0.42/year, 95% CI: −0.44, −0.40) and episodic memory (β = −0.59/year, 95% CI: −0.64, −0.54) were observed. Greater AQ improvement was associated with slower decline in TICSm (βPM2.5improvement = 0.026 per year for improved PM2.5 by each IQR = 1.79 μg/m3 reduction, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.05; βNO2improvement = 0.034 per year for improved NO2 by each IQR = 3.92 parts per billion [ppb] reduction, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.06) and CVLT (βPM2.5 improvement = 0.070 per year for improved PM2.5 by each IQR = 1.79 μg/m3 reduction, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.12; βNO2improvement = 0.060 per year for improved NO2 by each IQR = 3.97 ppb reduction, 95% CI: 0.005, 0.12) after adjusting for covariates. The respective associations with TICSm and CVLT were equivalent to the slower decline rate found with 0.9 to 1.2 and1.4 to 1.6 years of younger age and did not significantly differ by age, region, education, Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) e4 genotypes, or cardiovascular risk factors. The main limitations of this study include measurement error in exposure estimates, potential unmeasured confounding, and limited generalizability.

However, whether this modest elevation triggers neurodegeneration is not known. Although high levels of TDP-43 overexpression have been modeled in mice and shown to cause early death, models with low-level overexpression that mimic the human condition have not been established. In this study, transgenic mice overexpressing wild type TDP-43 at less than 60% above the endogenous CNS levels were constructed, and their phenotypes analyzed by a variety of techniques, including biochemical, molecular, histological, behavioral techniques and electromyography. The TDP-43 transgene was expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in the cortex and predominantly in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord. The mice developed a reproducible progressive weakness ending in paralysis in mid-life. Detailed analysis showed ∼30% loss of large pyramidal neurons in the layer V motor cortex; in the spinal cord, severe demyelination was accompanied by oligodendrocyte injury, protein aggregation, astrogliosis and microgliosis, and elevation of neuroinflammation. Surprisingly, there was no loss of lower motor neurons in the lumbar spinal cord despite the complete paralysis of the hindlimbs. However, denervation was detected at the neuromuscular junction. These results demonstrate that low-level TDP-43 overexpression can cause diverse aspects of ALS, including late-onset and progressive motor dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Our findings suggest that persistent modest elevations in TDP-43 expression can lead to ALS and other neurological disorders involving TDP-43 proteinopathy.

Therefore, compounds that enhance mitochondrial uncoupling are potentially attractive anti-aging therapies; however, chronic ingestion is associated with a number of unwanted side effects. We have previously developed a controlled-release mitochondrial protonophore (CRMP) that is functionally liver-directed and promotes oxidation of hepatic triglycerides by causing a subtle sustained increase in hepatic mitochondrial inefficiency. Here, we sought to leverage the higher therapeutic index of CRMP to test whether mild mitochondrial uncoupling in a liver-directed fashion could reduce oxidative damage and improve age-related metabolic disease and lifespan in diet-induced obese mice. Oral administration of CRMP (20 mg/[kg-day] × 4 weeks) reduced hepatic lipid content, protein kinase C epsilon activation, and hepatic insulin resistance in aged (74-week-old) high-fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6J male mice, independently of changes in body weight, whole-body energy expenditure, food intake, or markers of hepatic mitochondrial biogenesis. CRMP treatment was also associated with a significant reduction in hepatic lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, and inflammation. Importantly, long-term (49 weeks) hepatic mitochondrial uncoupling initiated late in life (94–104 weeks), in conjugation with HFD feeding, protected mice against neoplastic disorders, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in a strain and sex-specific manner.

Methods: At baseline, 962 adults (women, 54·4%; age range, 21–98 years) participated in the InCHIANTI, “Aging in the Chianti Area” study, and proteomics data were generated from their plasma specimens. Of these, 623 participants had proteomics data available at the 9-year follow-up. For each visit, a total of 1301 plasma proteins were measured using SOMAscan technology. Complete data on vital status were available up to the 15-year follow-up period. Protein-specific exponential distribution accelerated failure time, and linear regression analyses adjusted for possible covariates were used for mortality and mediation analyses, respectively (survival data analysis). Findings: Baseline values of EGFR, GHR, NTRK3, SOD2, KLRF1, THBS2, TIMP1, IGFBP2, C9, APOB, and LRP1B mediated the association between baseline RDW and all-cause mortality. Changes in IGFBP2 and C7 over 9 years mediated the association between changes in RDW and 6-year all-cause mortality. Interpretation: Cellular senescence may contribute to the association between RDW and mortality. Funding: This study was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Institute on Aging (NIA) contract and was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the NIA, NIH.

Whether mitochondrial dysfunction predicts subsequent mobility decline is unknown. Methods: We examined 380 cognitively normal participants aged 60 and older (53%women, 22%Black) who were well-functioning (gait speed ≥ 1.0 m/s) and free of Parkinson's disease and stroke at baseline and had data on baseline skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and one or more mobility assessments during an average 2.5 years. Muscle oxidative capacity was measured by phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy as the post-exercise recovery rate of phosphocreatine (kPCr). Mobility was measured by four walking tests. Associations of baseline kPCr with mobility changes were examined using linear mixed-effects models, adjusted for covariates. In a subset, we examined whether changes in muscle strength and mass affected these associations by adjusting for longitudinal muscle strength, lean mass, and fat mass. Results: Lower baseline kPCr was associated with greater decline in all four mobility measures (β, p-value: (0.036, 0.020) 6-m usual gait speed; (0.029, 0.038) 2.5-min usual gait speed; (0.034, 0.011) 6-m rapid gait speed; (−0.042, <0.001) 400-m time). In the subset, further adjustment for longitudinal muscle strength, lean mass, and fat mass attenuated longitudinal associations with changes in mobility (Δβ reduced 26–63%). Conclusion: Among initially well-functioning older adults, worse muscle mitochondrial function predicts mobility decline, and part of this longitudinal association is explained by decline in muscle strength and mass. Our findings suggest that worse mitochondrial function contributes to mobility decline with aging.

Results: In humans, plasma levels of ketamine and norketamine were higher in males than females, while (2R,6R;2S,6S)-HNK levels were not different. Following ketamine administration to mice (10 mg/kg i.p.), Cmax and total plasma concentrations of ketamine and norketamine were higher, and those of (2R,6R;2S,6S)-HNK were lower, in intact males compared to females. Direct (2R,6R)-HNK administration (10 mg/kg i.p.) resulted in higher levels of (2R,6R)-HNK in female mice.

Accordingly, mitochondrial dysfunction and genomic instability have been considered as key hallmarks of aging and have important roles in age-associated cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders. In order to evaluate whether maintenance of cognitive abilities at very old age is associated with key hallmarks of aging, we measured mitochondrial bioenergetics, mitochondrial DNA copy number and DNA repair capacity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from centenarians in a Danish 1915 birth cohort (n = 120). Also, the circulating levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, NAD+ /NADH and carbonylated proteins were measured in plasma of the centenarians and correlated to cognitive capacity. Mitochondrial respiration was well preserved in the centenarian cohort when compared to young individuals (21–35 years of age, n = 33). When correlating cognitive performance of the centenarians with mitochondrial function such as basal respiration, ATP production, reserve capacity and maximal respiration, no overall correlations were observed, but when stratifying by sex, inverse associations were observed in the males (p < 0.05). Centenarians with the most severe cognitive impairment displayed the lowest activity of the central DNA repair enzyme, APE1 (p < 0.05). A positive correlation between cognitive capacity and levels of NAD+ /NADH was observed (p < 0.05), which may be because NAD+ /NADH consuming enzyme activities strive to reduce the oxidative DNA damage load. Also, circulating protein carbonylation was lowest in centenarians with highest cognitive capacity (p < 0.05).

The loss of β-cells is initiated when self-tolerance to β-cell-derived contents breaks down, which leads to T cell-mediated β-cell damage and, ultimately, β-cell apoptosis. Many investigations have demonstrated the positive effects of antagonizing cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) in metabolic diseases such as fatty liver disease, obesity, and diabetes mellitus, but the role of cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R) in such diseases is relatively unknown. Activation of CB2R is known for its immunosuppressive roles in multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s, celiac, and lupus diseases, and since autoimmune diseases can share common environmental and genetic factors, we propose CB2R specific agonists may also serve as disease modifiers in diabetes mellitus. The CNR2 gene, which encodes CB2R protein, is the result of a gene duplication of CNR1, which encodes CB1R protein. This ortholog evolved rapidly after transitioning from invertebrates to vertebrate hundreds of million years ago. Human specific CNR2 isoforms are induced by inflammation in pancreatic islets, and a CNR2 nonsynonymous SNP (Q63R) is associated with autoimmune diseases. We collected evidence from the literature and from our own studies demonstrating that CB2R is involved in regulating the inflammasome and especially release of the cytokine interleukin 1B (IL-1β). Furthermore, CB2R activation controls intracellular autophagy and may regulate secretion of extracellular vesicles from adipocytes that participate in recycling of lipid droplets, dysregulation of which induces chronic inflammation and obesity. CB2R activation may play a similar role in islets of Langerhans.

Among participants aged 55 years and older in 2008, we excluded those with any memory problems between 2006 and 2008 and included those with complete follow-up on incident Alzheimer's disease and all-cause dementia, between 2010 and 2018 (N = 9683), based on self- or proxy-diagnosis every 2 years (2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018). Cox proportional hazards and 4-way decomposition models were conducted. Analyses were also stratified by sex and by race. There were racial differences in all-cause dementia incidence (age and sex-adjusted model, per standard deviation: hazard ratio, HR = 1.34, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.09-1.65, P = 0.007), partially driven by educational attainment and income. We also found independent associations of race (age and sex-adjusted model, African American versus White adults: HR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.52-2.83, P < 0.001) and Alzheimer's disease polygenic score (age and sex-adjusted model, per SD: HR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.00-1.87, P < 0.001) with Alzheimer's disease incidence, including sex differences whereby women had a stronger effect of Alzheimer's disease polygenic score on Alzheimer's disease incidence compared with men (P < 0.05 for sex by Alzheimer's disease polygenic score interaction) adjusting for race and other covariates. The total impact of Alzheimer's disease polygenic scores on Alzheimer's disease incidence was mostly direct, while the effect of race on all-cause dementia incidence was mediated through socio-economic, lifestyle and health-related factors. Finally, among the 30 polygenic scores we examined, the total effects on the pathway Alzheimer's disease polygenic score - > Other polygenic score - > Incident Alzheimer's or all-cause dementia, were statistically significant for all, driven primarily by the controlled direct effect (P< 0. 001). In conclusion, both race and Alzheimer's disease polygenic scores were associated independently with Alzheimer's disease and all-cause dementia incidence. Alzheimer's disease polygenic score was more strongly linked to incident Alzheimer's disease among women, while racial difference in all-cause dementia was explained by other factors including socio-economic status.",3,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,fcac317,21101098750,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,405,NA,NA,NA,ageing | Alzheimer's disease | dementia | national surveys | polygenic scores,NA

A significant age-related feature observed in many population cohorts is somatic mosaicism, the detectable accumulation of somatic mutations in multiple cell types and tissues, particularly those with high rates of cell turnover (e.g., skin, liver, and hematopoietic cells). Somatic mosaicism can lead to the development of cellular clones that expand with age in otherwise normal tissues. In the hematopoietic system, this phenomenon has generally been referred to as “clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential” (CHIP) when it applies to a subset of clones in which mutations in driver genes of hematologic malignancies are found. Other mechanisms of clonal hematopoiesis, including large chromosomal alterations, can also give rise to clonal expansion in the absence of conventional CHIP driver gene mutations. Both types of clonal hematopoiesis (CH) have been observed in studies of animal models and humans in association with altered immune responses, increased mortality, and disease risk. Studies in murine models have found that some of these clonal events are involved in abnormal inflammatory and metabolic changes, altered DNA damage repair and epigenetic changes. Studies in long-lived individuals also show the accumulation of somatic mutations, yet at this advanced age, carriership of somatic mutations is no longer associated with an increased risk of mortality. While it remains to be elucidated what factors modify this genotype-phenotype association, i.e., compensatory germline genetics, cellular context of the mutations, protective effects to diseases at exceptional age, it points out that the exceptionally long-lived are key to understand the phenotypic consequences of CHIP mutations. Assessment of the clinical significance of somatic mutations occurring in blood cell types for age-related outcomes in human populations of varied life and health span, environmental exposures, and germline genetic risk factors will be valuable in the development of personalized strategies tailored to specific somatic mutations for healthy aging.",12,Journal,re,Review,100,16,16,841796,21101158871,NIA,undefined,National Institute on Aging,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,406,NA,NA,NA,aging | CHIP | clonal hematopoiesis | longevity | somatic mutations,NA

Here, we show classical cardiac hypertrophy markers were absent in TGAC8, and that total left ventricular (LV) mass was not increased: a reduced LV cavity volume in TGAC8 was encased by thicker LV walls harboring an increased number of small cardiac myocytes, and a network of small interstitial proliferative non-cardiac myocytes compared to wild type (WT) littermates; Protein synthesis, proteosome activity, and autophagy were enhanced in TGAC8 vs WT, and Nrf-2, Hsp90α, and ACC2 protein levels were increased.

Unbiased omics analyses identified more than 2,000 transcripts and proteins, comprising a broad array of biological processes across multiple cellular compartments, which differed by genotype; compared to WT, in TGAC8 there was a shift from fatty acid oxidation to aerobic glycolysis in the context of increased utilization of the pentose phosphate shunt and nucleotide synthesis.

We applied a novel robust collaborative clustering (RCC) approach on the MRI and flortaucipir PET scans. We derived indices for AD-like (SPARE-AD index) and brain age (SPARE-BA) atrophy. Results: We identified four tau (I–IV) and three atrophy clusters. Tau clusters were associated with the apolipoprotein E genotype. Atrophy clusters were associated with white matter hyperintensity volumes. Only the hippocampal sparing atrophy cluster showed a specific association with brain aging imaging index.

Frailty is considered to correspond to a biological syndrome associated with age. Frail patients may ultimately develop multiple dysfunctions across several systems, including stroke, transient ischemic attack, vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, cortico-basal degeneration, multiple system atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclero-sis, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Patients with dementia and frailty often develop malnutrition and weight loss. Rigorous nutritional, pharmacological, and non-pharmacologi-cal interventions generally are required for these patients, which is a challenging issue for healthcare providers. A healthy diet and lifestyle instigated at an early age can reduce the risk of frailty and dementia. For optimal treatment, accurate diagnosis involving clinical evaluation, cognitive screening, essential laboratory evaluation, structural imaging, functional neuroimaging, and neuropsychological testing is necessary. Diagnosis proce-dures best apply the clinical diagnosis, identifying the cause(s) and the condition(s) ap-propriate for treatment. The patient's history, caregiver's interview, physical examination, cognitive evaluation, laboratory tests, and structural imaging should best be involved in the diagnostic process. Varying types of physical exercise can aid the treatment of these disorders.

The core purpose of this article is to investigate trends in the management of dementia and frailty, focusing on improving diagnosis and treatment.

The degree of the involvement of amyloid-β versus existing tau pathology in tau propagation and neurodegeneration has not been fully elucidated in human studies. Careful quantification of these effects can inform the development and timing of therapeutic interventions. We conducted causal mediation analyses to investigate the relative contributions of amyloid-β and existing tau to tau propagation and neurodegeneration in two longitudinal studies of individuals without dementia: the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (N = 103, age range 57-96) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (N = 122, age range 56-92). As proxies of neurodegeneration, we investigated cerebral blood flow, glucose metabolism, and regional volume. We first confirmed that amyloid-β moderates the association between tau in the entorhinal cortex and in the inferior temporal gyrus, a neocortical region exhibiting early tau pathology (amyloid group × entorhinal tau interaction term β = 0.488, standard error [SE] = 0.126, P < 0.001 in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging; β = 0.619, SE = 0.145, P < 0.001 in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative). In causal mediation analyses accounting for this facilitating effect of amyloid, amyloid positivity had a statistically significant direct effect on inferior temporal tau as well as an indirect effect via entorhinal tau (average direct effect =0.47, P < 0.001 and average causal mediation effect =0.44, P = 0.0028 in Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging; average direct effect =0.43, P = 0.004 and average causal mediation effect =0.267, P = 0.0088 in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative). Entorhinal tau mediated up to 48% of the total effect of amyloid on inferior temporal tau. Higher inferior temporal tau was associated with lower colocalized cerebral blood flow, glucose metabolism, and regional volume, whereas amyloid had only an indirect effect on these measures via tau, implying tau as the primary driver of neurodegeneration (amyloid-cerebral blood flow average causal mediation effect =-0.28, P = 0.021 in Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging; amyloid-volume average causal mediation effect =-0.24, P < 0.001 in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative).

Although numerous cross-sectional studies have identified various risk and protective factors of frailty, there is a limited understanding of longitudinal frailty progression. Furthermore, discrepancies in the methodologies of these studies hamper comparability of results. Here, we use a coordinated analytical approach in 5 independent cohorts to evaluate longitudinal trajectories of frailty and the effect of 3 previously identified critical risk factors: sex, age, and education. Research Design and Methods: We derived a frailty index (FI) for 5 cohorts based on the accumulation of deficits approach. Four linear and quadratic growth curve models were fit in each cohort independently. Models were adjusted for sex/gender, age, years of education, and a sex/gender-by-age interaction term. Results: Models describing linear progression of frailty best fit the data. Annual increases in FI ranged from 0.002 in the Invecchiare in Chianti cohort to 0.009 in the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA). Women had consistently higher levels of frailty than men in all cohorts, ranging from an increase in the mean FI in women from 0.014 in the Health and Retirement Study cohort to 0.046 in the LASA cohort. However, the associations between sex/gender and rate of frailty progression were mixed. There was significant heterogeneity in within-person trajectories of frailty about the mean curves.

Supervised machine learning models can derive multivariate patterns of brain change related to the two processes, including the Spatial Patterns of Atrophy for Recognition of Alzheimer's Disease (SPARE-AD) and of Brain Aging (SPARE-BA) scores investigated herein. However, the substantial overlap between brain regions affected in the two processes confounds measuring them independently. We present a methodology, and associated results, towards disentangling the two. T1-weighted MRI scans of 4054 participants (48-95 years) with Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or cognitively normal (CN) diagnoses from the Imaging-based coordinate SysTem for AGIng and NeurodeGenerative diseases (iSTAGING) consortium were analysed. Multiple sets of SPARE scores were investigated, in order to probe imaging signatures of certain clinically or molecularly defined sub-cohorts. First, a subset of clinical Alzheimer's disease patients (n = 718) and age- and sex-matched CN adults (n = 718) were selected based purely on clinical diagnoses to train SPARE-BA1 (regression of age using CN individuals) and SPARE-AD1 (classification of CN versus Alzheimer's disease) models. Second, analogous groups were selected based on clinical and molecular markers to train SPARE-BA2 and SPARE-AD2 models: amyloid-positive Alzheimer's disease continuum group (n = 718; consisting of amyloid-positive Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-positive MCI, amyloid- and tau-positive CN individuals) and amyloid-negative CN group (n = 718). Finally, the combined group of the Alzheimer's disease continuum and amyloid-negative CN individuals was used to train SPARE-BA3 model, with the intention to estimate brain age regardless of Alzheimer's disease-related brain changes. The disentangled SPARE models, SPARE-AD2 and SPARE-BA3, derived brain patterns that were more specific to the two types of brain changes. The correlation between the SPARE-BA Gap (SPARE-BA minus chronological age) and SPARE-AD was significantly reduced after the decoupling (r = 0.56-0.06). The correlation of disentangled SPARE-AD was non-inferior to amyloid- and tau-related measurements and to the number of APOE ϵ4 alleles but was lower to Alzheimer's disease-related psychometric test scores, suggesting the contribution of advanced brain ageing to the latter. The disentangled SPARE-BA was consistently less correlated with Alzheimer's disease-related clinical, molecular and genetic variables.

Objective: We hypothesized that 1) high expression of ApoER2 (receptor for ApoE and Reelin) helps explain this anatomical vulnerability; 2) lipid peroxidation of ApoE and ApoER2 contributes to sAD pathogenesis, by disrupting neuronal ApoE delivery and Reelin-ApoER2-Dab1 signaling cascades. Methods: In vitro biochemical experiments; Single-marker and multiplex fluorescence-immunohistochemistry (IHC) in postmortem specimens from 26 individuals who died cognitively normal, with mild cognitive impairment or with sAD. Results: ApoE and ApoER2 peptides and proteins were susceptible to attack by reactive lipid aldehydes, generating lipid-protein adducts and crosslinked ApoE-ApoER2 complexes. Using in situ hybridization alongside IHC, we observed that: 1) ApoER2 is strongly expressed in terminal zones of the entorhinal-hippocampal 'perforant path' projections that underlie memory; 2) ApoE, lipid aldehyde-modified ApoE, Reelin, ApoER2, and the downstream Reelin-ApoER2 cascade components Dab1 and Thr19-phosphorylated PSD95 accumulated in the vicinity of neuritic plaques in perforant path terminal zones in sAD cases; 3) several ApoE/Reelin-ApoER2-Dab1 pathway markers were higher in sAD cases and positively correlated with histological progression and cognitive deficits. Conclusion: Results demonstrate derangements in multiple ApoE/Reelin-ApoER2-Dab1 axis components in perforant path terminal zones in sAD and provide proof-of-concept that ApoE and ApoER2 are vulnerable to aldehyde-induced adduction and crosslinking.

We sought to describe the baseline assessment approaches, health conditions, and risk profiles for brain aging of participants in the randomized controlled Multimodal INterventions to delay Dementia and disability in rural China (MIND-China). Methods: MIND-China engaged residents who were ≥60 years of age and living in rural communities in the western Shandong province. In March to September 2018, all participants underwent the core module assessments via face-to-face interviews, clinical examinations, neuropsychological testings, and laboratory tests. Specific modules of examination were performed for sub-samples, including brain magnetic resonance imaging scans, genetic and blood biochemical markers, actigraphy testing, cardiopulmonary coupling analysis for sleep quality and disturbances, audiometric testing, and optical coherence tomography examination. We performed descriptive analysis. Results: In total, 5765 participants (74.9% of all eligible residents) undertook the baseline assessments. The mean age was 70.9 years (standard deviation, 5.9), 57.2% were women, 40.6% were illiterate, and 88.3% were farmers. The overall prevalence of common chronic diseases was 67.2% for hypertension, 23.4% for dyslipidemia, 23.5% for heart disease, 14.4% for diabetes mellitus, and 5.4% for dementia. The prevalence rates of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, obesity, heart disease, depressive symptoms, and dementia were higher in women than in men (P <.05). Overall, 87.1% of the participants had at least two of the 15 chronic diseases (89.3% in women vs 84.2% in men, P <.001). Participants examined for the specific modules were younger, more likely to be women, and more educated than those not examined. Discussion: Comprehensive baseline assessments of participants in MIND-China provide extremely valuable data sources for interdisciplinary research into the complex relationships of aging, health, brain aging, and functional consequences among older adults living in the rural communities. Highlights: MIND-China is a multimodal intervention study among rural residents ≥60 years of age. At baseline, 5765 participants undertook the interdisciplinary assessments. The baseline assessments consisted of core module and specific modules. Specific modules included brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), blood biomarkers, ActiGraph, cardiopulmonary coupling (CPC), pure-tone audiometry (PTA), and optical coherence tomography (OCT).",58,Journal,ar,Article,100,26,26,e12254,21100415705,ADDF,2019QL020,Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,444,NA,NA,NA,dementia | multimodal intervention | older adults | population-based study | rural area,NA

Herein, we propose a comprehensive analytical strategy for identifying, representing, and analyzing biological time series, focusing on two strongly linked dynamics: periodic (oscillatory) rhythms and chaos. Understanding the underlying temporal dynamics of a system is of fundamental importance; however, it presents methodological challenges due to intrinsic characteristics, among them the presence of noise or trends, and distinct dynamics at different time scales given by molecular, dcellular, organ, and organism levels of organization. For example, in locomotion circadian and ultradian rhythms coexist with fractal dynamics at faster time scales. We propose and describe the use of a combined approach employing different analytical methodologies to synergize their strengths and mitigate their weaknesses. Specifically, we describe advantages and caveats to consider for applying probability distribution, autocorrelation analysis, phase space reconstruction, Lyapunov exponent estimation as well as different analyses such as harmonic, namely, power spectrum; continuous wavelet transforms; synchrosqueezing transform; and wavelet coherence.

Methods: We analyzed 364 initially cognitively normal participants (58% women, 24% black) who had baseline olfaction data and subsequent cognitive assessments during an average 2.4-year. A subset of 129 had PET-PiB (Aβ) (n = 72 repeated) and 105 had 18F-flortaucipir (FTP)-PET (tau) (n = 44 repeated). Olfaction was measured using a 16-item Sniffin' Sticks Odor Identification Test.

Methods: Data are from 4,354 persons (mean age 76±5 years) without dementia at baseline from the AGES-Reykjavik Study. LLD was assessed with the MINI diagnostic interview (current and remitted major depressive disorder [MDD]) and the Geriatric Depression Scale-15.

Methods: We used summary statistics from publicly available studies to estimate the association of genetic polymorphisms with lifestyle behaviors, and from Courage-PD (7,369 cases, 7,018 controls; European ancestry) to estimate the association of these variants with PD. We used the inverse-variance weighted method to compute odds ratios (ORIVW) of PD and 95%confidence intervals (CI).

Here, we targeted the inflammatory component of PD pathology, by testing for the first time the disease-modifying properties of the immunomodulatory imide drug (IMiD) pomalidomide in a translational rat model of PD neuropathology based on the intranigral bilateral infusion of toxic preformed oligomers of human α-synuclein (H-αSynOs). The neuroprotective effect of pomalidomide (20 mg/kg; i.p. three times/week 48 h apart) was tested in the first stage of disease progression by means of a chronic two-month administration, starting 1 month after H-αSynOs infusion, when an already ongoing neuroinflammation is observed. The intracerebral infusion of H-αSynOs induced an impairment in motor and coordination performance that was fully rescued by pomalidomide, as assessed via a battery of motor tests three months after infusion. Moreover, H-αSynOs-infused rats displayed a 40–45% cell loss within the bilateral substantia nigra, as measured by stereological counting of TH + and Nissl-stained neurons, that was largely abolished by pomalidomide. The inflammatory response to H-αSynOs infusion and the pomalidomide treatment was evaluated both in CNS affected areas and peripherally in the serum. A reactive microgliosis, measured as the volume occupied by the microglial marker Iba-1, was present in the substantia nigra three months after H-αSynOs infusion as well as after H-αSynOs plus pomalidomide treatment. However, microglia differed for their phenotype among experimental groups. After H-αSynOs infusion, microglia displayed a proinflammatory profile, producing a large amount of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α. In contrast, pomalidomide inhibited the TNF-α overproduction and elevated the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Moreover, the H-αSynOs infusion induced a systemic inflammation with overproduction of serum proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, that was largely mitigated by pomalidomide. Results provide evidence of the disease modifying potential of pomalidomide in a neuropathological rodent model of PD and support the repurposing of this drug for clinical testing in PD patients.",11,Journal,ar,Article,100,19,19,NA,5100155080,NIH,819644,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,464,19337213,305-324,NA,Alpha-synuclein | Cytokine | Drug repositioning | Immunomodulation | Motor impairment | Neuroprotection,NA

Curcumin, a natural antioxidant, has putative therapeutic properties such as improving insulin sensitivity in obese mice. However, how curcumin contributes to maintaining insulin homeostasis in aged organisms largely remains unclear. Thus, the objective of this study is to examine the pleiotropic effect of dietary curcumin on insulin homeostasis in a diet-induced obese (DIO) aged mouse model. Aged (18-20 months old) male mice given a high-fat high-sugar diet supplemented with 0.4% (w/w) curcumin (equivalent to 2 g/day for a 60 kg adult) displayed a different metabolic phenotype compared to mice given a high-fat high-sugar diet alone. Furthermore, curcumin supplementation altered hepatic gene expression profiling, especially insulin signaling and senescence pathways. We then mechanistically investigated how curcumin functions to fine-tune insulin sensitivity. We found that curcumin supplementation increased hepatic insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) expression levels and preserved islet integrity, both outcomes that are beneficial to preserving good health with age.

Prior research has shown that oral ketone monoester (KME) safely induces robust ketosis in humans and has demonstrated cognitive-enhancing and pathology-reducing properties in animal models of AD. However, human evidence that KME may enhance brain ketone metabolism, improve cognitive performance and engage AD pathogenic cascades is scarce. Objectives: To investigate the effects of ketone monoester (KME) on brain metabolism, cognitive performance and AD pathogenic cascades in cognitively normal older adults with metabolic syndrome and therefore at higher risk for AD. DESIGN: Double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial. Setting: Clinical Unit of the National Institute on Aging, Baltimore, US. Participants: Fifty cognitively intact adults ≥ 55 years old, with metabolic syndrome. Intervention: Drinks containing 25 g of KME or isocaloric placebo consumed three times daily for 28 days. Outcomes: Primary: concentration of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in precuneus measured with Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS). Exploratory: plasma and urine BHB, multiple brain and muscle metabolites detected with MRS, cognition assessed with the PACC and NIH toolbox, biomarkers of AD and metabolic mediators in plasma extracellular vesicles, and stool microbiome. Discussion: This is the first study to investigate the AD-biomarker and cognitive effects of KME in humans. Ketone monoester is safe, tolerable, induces robust ketosis, and animal studies indicate that it can modify AD pathology.

Health disparities are characteristically seen in commonly occurring age-associated diseases such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease as well as diabetes mellitus and cancer. The early appearance and increased severity of age-associated disease among African American and low socioeconomic status (SES) individuals suggests that the factors contributing to the emergence of health disparities may also induce a phenotype of ‘premature aging’ or ‘accelerated aging’ or ‘weathering’. In marginalized and low SES populations with high rates of early onset age-associated disease the interaction of biologic, psychosocial, socioeconomic and environmental factors may result in a phenotype of accelerated aging biologically similar to premature aging syndromes with increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, premature accumulation of oxidative DNA damage, defects in DNA repair and higher levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation.

Genetic variation will likely influence outcomes when studying metformin health effects in human populations. To test for metformin impact in diverse genetic backgrounds, we measured lifespan and healthspan effects of metformin treatment in three Caenorhabditis species representing genetic variability greater than that between mice and humans. We show that metformin increases median survival in three C. elegans strains, but not in C. briggsae and C. tropicalis strains. In C. briggsae, metformin either has no impact on survival or decreases lifespan. In C. tropicalis, metformin decreases median survival in a dose-dependent manner. We show that metformin prolongs the period of youthful vigor in all C. elegans strains and in two C. briggsae strains, but that metformin has a negative impact on the locomotion of C. tropicalis strains. Our data demonstrate that metformin can be a robust promoter of healthy aging across different genetic backgrounds, but that genetic variation can determine whether metformin has positive, neutral, or negative lifespan/healthspan impact.

Clearly communicating the manual processes to capture this information is cumbersome, yet essential to lay a solid foundation for comprehensive atlases. Segmentation protocols must be designed so the interpretation of the requested tasks as well as locating structural landmarks is anatomically accurate, intuitive and reproducible.

The g-ratio, mathematically defined as the inner-to-outer diameter of a myelinated axon, is used as a structural index of optimal axonal myelination and has been shown to represent a sensitive imaging biomarker of microstructural integrity. Several magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods for whole-brain mapping of aggregate g-ratio have been introduced. Computation of the aggerate g-ratio requires estimates of the myelin volume fraction (MVF) and the axonal volume fraction (AVF). While accurate determinations of MVF and AVF can be obtained through multicomponent relaxometry or diffusion analyses, respectively, these methods require lengthy acquisition times making their implementation challenging in a clinical context. Therefore, any attempt to overcome this drawback is needed. Expanding on our previous work, we introduced a new MRI method for whole-brain mapping of aggregate g-ratio. This new approach is based on the use of a single-shell diffusion for AVF determination, reducing the acquisition time by approximately ~10 min from our recently introduced approach, while offering the possibility to investigate g-ratio differences in previous studies with existing data for MVF mapping and single-shell diffusion data for AVF mapping. Our comparison analysis indicates that our newly derived aggregate g-ratio values were similar to those derived from our previous method, which requires a longer acquisition time.

A statistical approach that integrates these effects across all common variants may be clinically useful for individual risk stratification. A polygenic hazard score methodology, leveraging a time-to-event framework, has recently been successfully applied in other age-related disorders. Objectives: We aimed to develop and validate a polygenic hazard score model in sporadic PD. Methods: Using a Cox regression framework, we modeled the polygenic hazard score in a training data set of 11,693 PD patients and 9841 controls. The score was then validated in an independent test data set of 5112 PD patients and 5372 controls and a small single-study sample of 360 patients and 160 controls. Results: A polygenic hazard score predicts the onset of PD with a hazard ratio of 3.78 (95% confidence interval 3.49–4.10) when comparing the highest to the lowest risk decile. Combined with epidemiological data on incidence rate, we apply the score to estimate genetically stratified instantaneous PD risk across age groups. Conclusions: We demonstrate the feasibility of a polygenic hazard approach in PD, integrating the genetic effects on disease risk and age at onset in a single model. In combination with other predictive biomarkers, the approach may hold promise for risk stratification in future clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies, which aim at postponing the onset of PD. © 2021 The Authors.

Objectives: This study aimed to investigate in a large meta-analysis whether the LRRK2 Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) signal represented by rs76904798 is independently associated with PD risk from LRRK2 coding variation and whether complex linkage disequilibrium structures with p.G2019S and the 5′ noncoding haplotype account for the association of LRRK2 coding variants. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis using imputed genotypes from 17,838 patients, 13,404 proxy patients, and 173,639 healthy controls of European ancestry. We excluded carriers of p.G2019S and/or rs76904798 to clarify the role of LRRK2 coding variation in mediating disease risk and excluded carriers of relatively rare LRRK2 coding variants to assess the independence of rs76904798. We also investigated the co-inheritance of LRRK2 coding variants with p.G2019S, rs76904798, and p.N2081D. Results: LRRK2 rs76904798 remained significantly associated with PD after excluding the carriers of relatively rare LRRK2 coding variants. LRRK2 p.R1514Q and p.N2081D were frequently co-inherited with rs76904798, and the allele distribution of p.S1647T significantly changed among patients after removing rs76904798 carriers. Conclusions: These data suggest that the LRRK2 coding variants previously related to PD (p.N551K, p.R1398H, p.M1646T, and p.N2081D) do not drive the 5′ noncoding GWAS signal.

Although pathophysiology remains incompletely understood, prior work demonstrates associations with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). The purpose of this study was to quantify BDNF and COMT in plasma and in neuronal-enriched extracellular vesicles (nEVs), assess relationships with psychological symptoms, and gain insight on the brain-gut connection in IBS. Methods: Clinical data and biorepository samples from a parent investigation were used, including scores on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Distinct subpopulations of nEVs were isolated using neural cell adhesion molecule L1CAM; levels of COMT, mature BDNF, and pro-BDNF were quantified in plasma and in nEVs using ELISA. Key Results: Data from 47 females (28.11 ± 6.85 years) included 18 IBS and 29 healthy control (HC) participants. IBS participants displayed reduced plasma levels of mature BDNF compared with HC (p = 0.024). Levels of COMT plasma and IBS grouping significantly predicted CES-D scores (p = 0.034). Exploratory analyses by IBS subtype and race revealed African American HC display lower levels of COMT EV than Caucasian HC (p = 0.022). Conclusions & Inferences: Lower levels of mature BDNF in IBS participants, preliminary patterns detected in cargo content of nEVs, and relevance of COMT and IBS status to CES-D scores, offer insight on depressive symptomatology and brain-gut dysregulation in IBS. Lower COMT levels in nEVs of African Americans highlight the relevance of race when conducting such analyses across diverse populations.",4,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,e14257,25337,NIH,ZIANR000018‐01‐11,National Institutes of Health,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,480,13501925,NA,34499398,NA,NA

Here, we present a multivariate genome-wide association analysis of overall variation in dietary intake to account for the correlation between dietary carbohydrate, fat and protein in 282,271 participants of European ancestry from the UK Biobank (n = 191,157) and Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium (n = 91,114), and identify 26 distinct genome-wide significant loci. Dietary intake signals map exclusively to specific brain regions and are enriched for genes expressed in specialized subtypes of GABAergic, dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurons. We identified two main clusters of genetic variants for overall variation in dietary intake that were differently associated with obesity and coronary artery disease. These results enhance the biological understanding of interindividual differences in dietary intake by highlighting neural mechanisms, supporting functional follow-up experiments and possibly providing new avenues for the prevention and treatment of prevalent complex metabolic diseases.",22,Journal,ar,Article,100,20,20,NA,21100838541,NIH,U01DK078616,National Institutes of Health,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,481,NA,155-163,34426670,NA,NA

The purpose of this study was to estimate the global burden associated with physical inactivity, and to examine differences by country income and region. Methods Population-level, prevalence-based population attributable risks (PAR) were calculated for 168 countries to estimate how much disease could be averted if physical inactivity were eliminated. We calculated PARs (percentage of cases attributable to inactivity) for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality and non-communicable diseases including coronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dementia, depression and cancers of the bladder, breast, colon, endometrium, oesophagus, stomach and kidney. Results Globally, 7.2% and 7.6% of all-cause and cardiovascular disease deaths, respectively, are attributable to physical inactivity. The proportions of non-communicable diseases attributable to physical inactivity range from 1.6% for hypertension to 8.1% for dementia. There was an increasing gradient across income groups; PARs were more than double in high-income compared with low-income countries. However, 69% of total deaths and 74% of cardiovascular disease deaths associated with physical inactivity are occurring in middle-income countries, given their population size. Regional differences were also observed, with the PARs occurring in Latin America/Caribbean and high-income Western and Asia-Pacific countries, and the lowest burden occurring in Oceania and East/Southeast Asia. Conclusion The global burden associated with physical inactivity is substantial. The relative burden is greatest in high-income countries; however, the greatest number of people (absolute burden) affected by physical inactivity are living in middle-income countries given the size of their populations.",403,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,NA,19817,NIH,U54-GM104940,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,482,03063674,101-106,33782046,physical activity | sedentary,NA

In this paper we will describe an animal (monkey) model we have developed to study behavioral/cardiovascular interactions. In the cardiac conditioning protocol the monkey was taught to avoid/escape tail shock by maintaining/slowing its heart rate; in the physical exercise protocol the monkey avoided/escaped tail shock by maintaining/increasing its level of exercise. When the two protocols are combined, the monkey could maintain a level of exercise sufficient to avoid shocks, but also could maintain a heart rate which is slow enough to avoid shocks. When the animal learned to perform the combined heart rate control and exercise, there also was evidence of significant improvement in the efficiency of cardiovascular performance during such control, e.g., the rate of increase of systolic or diastolic blood pressure as a function of work was attenuated, and the product of heart rate and systolic pressure (an index of amount of work done by the left ventricle of the heart) was reduced. The degree of left ventricular work was an important measure of the physical capacity of the heart to do work.",1,Book,ch,Book Chapter,100,2,2,NA,21101200547,NA,undefined,NA,0,FALSE,NA,NA,483,NA,353-366,NA,NA,NA
