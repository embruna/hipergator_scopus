Although a long history of research on neurocognitive aging has focused on the role of the cholinergic basal forebrain system, intermingled GABAergic cells are numerically as prominent and well-positioned to regulate the activity of their cortical projection targets, including the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. The effects of aging on non-cholinergic BF neurons in primates, however, are largely unknown. In this study, we conducted quantitative morphometric analyses in brains from young adult (6 females, 2 males) and aged (11 females, 5 males) rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) that displayed significant impairment on standard tests that require the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Cholinergic (ChAT+) and GABAergic (GAD67+) neurons were quantified through the full rostrocaudal extent of the BF. Total BF immunopositive neuron number (ChAT+ plus GAD67+) was significantly lower in aged monkeys compared to young, largely due to fewer GAD67+ cells. Additionally, GAD67+ neuron volume was greater selectively in aged monkeys without cognitive impairment compared to young monkeys.

As an individual’s genetic variants are constant throughout life, evaluating the combined effects of multiple disease-associated genetic risks enables reliable AD risk prediction. Because of the complexity of genomic data, current statistical analyses cannot comprehensively capture the polygenic risk of AD, resulting in unsatisfactory disease risk prediction. However, deep learning methods, which capture nonlinearity within high-dimensional genomic data, may enable more accurate disease risk prediction and improve our understanding of AD etiology. Accordingly, we developed deep learning neural network models for modeling AD polygenic risk. Methods: We constructed neural network models to model AD polygenic risk and compared them with the widely used weighted polygenic risk score and lasso models. We conducted robust linear regression analysis to investigate the relationship between the AD polygenic risk derived from deep learning methods and AD endophenotypes (i.e., plasma biomarkers and individual cognitive performance). We stratified individuals by applying unsupervised clustering to the outputs from the hidden layers of the neural network model. Results: The deep learning models outperform other statistical models for modeling AD risk. Moreover, the polygenic risk derived from the deep learning models enables the identification of disease-associated biological pathways and the stratification of individuals according to distinct pathological mechanisms.

Our results indicate that participants with lower usual or rapid gait speed exhibited lower values of myelin water fraction and R1 in the main brainstem regions, which were more evident and statistically significant in the midbrain.

EV biogenesis is triggered by ceramide enrichment at the plasma membrane from neutral sphingomyelinase2 (nSMase2)-mediated cleavage of sphingomyelin. We report, for the first time, that human tau expression elevates brain ceramides and nSMase2 activity. Methods: To determine the therapeutic benefit of inhibiting this elevation, we evaluated PDDC, the first potent, selective, orally bioavailable, and brain-penetrable nSMase2 inhibitor in the transgenic PS19 AD mouse model. Additionally, we directly evaluated the effect of PDDC on tau propagation in a mouse model where an adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding P301L/S320F double mutant human tau was stereotaxically-injected unilaterally into the hippocampus. The contralateral transfer of the double mutant human tau to the dentate gyrus was monitored. We examined ceramide levels, histopathological changes, and pTau content within EVs isolated from the mouse plasma. Results: Similar to human AD, the PS19 mice exhibited increased brain ceramide levels and nSMase2 activity; both were completely normalized by PDDC treatment. The PS19 mice also exhibited elevated tau immunostaining, thinning of hippocampal neuronal cell layers, increased mossy fiber synaptophysin immunostaining, and glial activation, all of which were pathologic features of human AD. PDDC treatment reduced these changes. The plasma of PDDC-treated PS19 mice had reduced levels of neuronal- and microglial-derived EVs, the former carrying lower pTau levels, compared to untreated mice. In the tau propagation model, PDDC normalized the tau-induced increase in brain ceramides and significantly reduced the amount of tau propagation to the contralateral side.

PRKN is located in FRA6E, which is one of the common fragile sites in the human genome, making this region prone to structural variants. However, complex structural variants such as inversions of PRKN are seldom reported, suggesting that there are potentially unrevealed complex pathogenic PRKN structural variants. Objectives: To identify complex structural variants in PRKN using long-read sequencing. Methods: We investigated the genetic cause of monozygotic twins presenting with a young onset dystonia-parkinsonism using targeted sequencing, whole exome sequencing, multiple ligation probe amplification, and long-read sequencing. We assessed the presence and frequency of complex inversions overlapping PRKN using whole-genome sequencing data of Accelerating Medicines Partnership Parkinson's disease (AMP-PD) and United Kingdom (UK)-Biobank datasets. Results: Multiple ligation probe amplification identified a heterozygous exon three deletion in PRKN and long-read sequencing identified a large novel inversion spanning over 7 Mb, including a large part of the coding DNA sequence of PRKN. We could diagnose the affected subjects as compound heterozygous carriers of PRKN. We analyzed whole genome sequencing data of 43,538 participants of the UK-Biobank and 4941 participants of the AMP-PD datasets. Nine inversions in the UK-Biobank and two in AMP PD were identified and were considered potentially damaging and likely to affect PRKN expression. Conclusions: This is the first report describing a large 7 Mb inversion involving breakpoints outside of PRKN.

In this study, we leveraged whole genome sequencing data from nearly 10 000 individuals recruited within the Genomics England sequencing project to investigate the normal and pathogenic variation of the RFC1 repeat. We identified three novel repeat motifs, AGGGC (n = 6 from five families), AAGGC (n = 2 from one family) and AGAGG (n = 1), associated with CANVAS in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state with the common pathogenic AAGGG expansion. While AAAAG, AAAGGG and AAGAG expansions appear to be benign, we revealed a pathogenic role for large AAAGG repeat configuration expansions (n = 5). Long-read sequencing was used to characterize the entire repeat sequence, and six patients exhibited a pure AGGGC expansion, while the other patients presented complex motifs with AAGGG or AAAGG interruptions. All pathogenic motifs appeared to have arisen from a common haplotype and were predicted to form highly stable G quadruplexes, which have previously been demonstrated to affect gene transcription in other conditions.

Here we show that FPC undergoes complex proteolytic processing in developing kidneys, generating three soluble C-terminal fragments (ICDs). Notably, ICD15, contains a novel mitochondrial targeting sequence at its N-terminus, facilitating its translocation into mitochondria. This enhances mitochondrial respiration in renal epithelial cells, partially restoring impaired mitochondrial function caused by FPC loss. FPC inactivation leads to abnormal ultrastructural morphology of mitochondria in kidney tubules without cyst formation. Moreover, FPC inactivation significantly exacerbates renal cystogenesis and triggers severe pancreatic cystogenesis in a Pkd1 mouse mutant Pkd1  V/V in which cleavage of Pkd1-encoded Polycystin-1 at the GPCR Proteolysis Site is blocked.

The goal of this summit was to connect basic scientists, clinical researchers, drug developers, and individuals affected by C9ORF72-FTD/ALS to evaluate how collaborative efforts across the FTD-ALS disease spectrum might break down existing disease silos. Presentations and discussions covered recent discoveries in C9ORF72-FTD/ALS disease mechanisms, availability of disease biomarkers and recent advances in therapeutic development, and clinical trial design for prevention and treatment for individuals affected by C9ORF72-FTD/ALS and asymptomatic pathological expansion carriers. The C9ORF72-associated hexanucleotide repeat expansion is an important locus for both ALS and FTD. C9ORF72-FTD/ALS may be characterized by loss of function of the C9ORF72 protein and toxic gain of functions caused by both dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins and hexanucleotide repeat RNA. C9ORF72-FTD/ALS therapeutic strategies discussed at the summit included the use of antisense oligonucleotides, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene silencing and gene delivery, and engineered small molecules targeting RNA structures associated with the C9ORF72 expansion. Neurofilament light chain, DPR proteins, and transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)–associated molecular changes were presented as biomarker candidates. Similarly, brain imaging modalities (i.e., magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and positron emission tomography [PET]) measuring structural, functional, and metabolic changes were discussed as important tools to monitor individuals affected with C9ORF72-FTD/ALS, at both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic disease stages. Finally, summit attendees evaluated current clinical trial designs available for FTD or ALS patients and concluded that therapeutics relevant to FTD/ALS patients, such as those specifically targeting C9ORF72, may need to be tested with composite endpoints covering clinical symptoms of both FTD and ALS. The latter will require novel clinical trial designs to be inclusive of all patient subgroups spanning the FTD/ALS spectrum.",14,Journal,no,Note,100,53,53,Biomarker | C9ORF72 | Dipeptide repeat protein | Gene therapy | Neurofilament | Prevention | RNA toxicity | TDP-43,NA,21100466855,NIH,ZIAAG000933-15,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,31,21938253,1821-1843,NA

For this purpose, we studied changes in neuroprotective proteins proBDNF, BDNF, and humanin in plasma NDEVs from patients with mild to moderate AD participating in the randomized controlled trial (RCT) of exercise ADEX. Methods: proBDNF, BDNF, and humanin were quantified in NDEVs immunocaptured from the plasma of 95 ADEX participants, randomized into exercise and control groups, and collected at baseline and 16 weeks. Exploratorily, we also quantified NDEV levels of putative exerkines known to respond to exercise in peripheral tissues. Results: NDEV levels of proBDNF, BDNF, and humanin increased in the exercise group, especially in APOE ε4 carriers, but remained unchanged in the control group. Inter-correlations between NDEV biomarkers observed at baseline were maintained after exercise. NDEV levels of putative exerkines remained unchanged. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the cognitive benefits of exercise could be mediated by the upregulation of neuroprotective factors in NDEVs. Additionally, our results indicate that AD subjects carrying APOE ε4 are more responsive to the neuroprotective effects of physical activity. Unchanged NDEV levels of putative exerkines after physical activity imply that exercise engages different pathways in neurons and peripheral tissues. Future studies should aim to expand upon the effects of exercise duration, intensity, and type in NDEVs from patients with early AD and additional neurodegenerative disorders.

Neutrophils to lymphocytes-ratio (NL-ratio) was proposed as an effective and low-cost marker to monitor and predict the evolution of several clinical conditions. The main objective of the study is to analyze its temporal trend variation, over twenty years’ follow-up, according to age, sex, and main clinical diagnosis, in a large representative Italian population. Methods: The InCHIANTI study enrolled representative samples from the registry list of two towns in Tuscany, Italy.

External validation studies on prognostic models for dementia have highlighted the need for updated models. The use of machine learning in dementia prediction is in its infancy and may improve predictive performance. The current study aimed to explore the difference in performance of machine learning algorithms compared to traditional statistical techniques, such as logistic and Cox regression, for prediction of all-cause dementia. Our secondary aim was to assess the feasibility of only using clinically accessible predictors rather than MRI predictors. Methods: Data are from 4,793 participants in the population-based AGES-Reykjavik Study without dementia or mild cognitive impairment at baseline (mean age: 76 years, % female: 59%). Cognitive, biometric, and MRI assessments (total: 59 variables) were collected at baseline, with follow-up of incident dementia diagnoses for a maximum of 12 years. Machine learning algorithms included elastic net regression, random forest, support vector machine, and elastic net Cox regression. Traditional statistical methods for comparison were logistic and Cox regression. Model 1 was fit using all variables and model 2 was after feature selection using the Boruta package. A third model explored performance when leaving out neuroimaging markers (clinically accessible model). Ten-fold cross-validation, repeated ten times, was implemented during training. Upsampling was used to account for imbalanced data. Tuning parameters were optimized for recalibration automatically using the caret package in R. Results: 19% of participants developed all-cause dementia. Machine learning algorithms were comparable in performance to logistic regression in all three models.

Introduction: The aim of this study was to quantify the fracture risk associated with a prior fracture on an international basis and to explore the relationship of this risk with age, sex, time since baseline and bone mineral density (BMD). Methods: We studied 665,971 men and 1,438,535 women from 64 cohorts in 32 countries followed for a total of 19.5 million person-years. The effect of a prior history of fracture on the risk of any clinical fracture, any osteoporotic fracture, major osteoporotic fracture, and hip fracture alone was examined using an extended Poisson model in each cohort. Covariates examined were age, sex, BMD, and duration of follow-up. The results of the different studies were merged by using the weighted β-coefficients. Results: A previous fracture history, compared with individuals without a prior fracture, was associated with a significantly increased risk of any clinical fracture (hazard ratio, HR = 1.88; 95% CI = 1.72–2.07). The risk ratio was similar for the outcome of osteoporotic fracture (HR = 1.87; 95% CI = 1.69–2.07), major osteoporotic fracture (HR = 1.83; 95% CI = 1.63–2.06), or for hip fracture (HR = 1.82; 95% CI = 1.62–2.06). There was no significant difference in risk ratio between men and women. Subsequent fracture risk was marginally downward adjusted when account was taken of BMD. Low BMD explained a minority of the risk for any clinical fracture (14%), osteoporotic fracture (17%), and for hip fracture (33%). The risk ratio for all fracture outcomes related to prior fracture decreased significantly with adjustment for age and time since baseline examination. Conclusion: A previous history of fracture confers an increased risk of fracture of substantial importance beyond that explained by BMD. The effect is similar in men and women. Its quantitation on an international basis permits the more accurate use of this risk factor in case finding strategies.",33,Journal,ar,Article,100,84,84,Hip fracture | Major osteoporotic fracture | Meta-analysis | Osteoporotic fracture | Prior fracture,NA,16453,NIH,75N92021D00002,National Institutes of Health,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,44,0937941X,2027-2045,37566158

How such behavioral sequences are learned is much less understood. Here we provide behavioral and neurophysiological evidence to show that behavioral sequences are learned using a stepwise strategy. In male rats learning a new association, learning started from the behavioral event closest to the reward and sequentially incorporated earlier events. This led to the sequential refinement of reward-seeking behaviors, which was characterized by the stepwise elimination of ineffective and non-rewarded behavioral sequences. At the neuronal level, this stepwise learning process was mirrored by the sequential emergence of basal forebrain neuronal responses toward each event, which quantitatively conveyed a reward prediction error signal and promoted reward-seeking behaviors.

Results: We report that EDA triggers the translocation of its receptor EDAR from a cytosolic compartment into the plasma membrane. We use protein affinity purification to show that upon EDA stimulation EDAR associates with SNAP23-STX6-VAMP1/2/3 vesicle trafficking complexes. We find that EDA-dependent PKA activation is critical for the association. Notably, either of two HED-linked EDAR mutations, T346M and R420W, prevents EDA-induced EDAR translocation; and both EDA-induced PKA activation and SNAP23 are required for Meibomian gland (MG) growth in a skin appendage model.

RESULTS: Compared with metformin initiators (n = 114,628), patients who received no anti-diabetes medication (n = 95,609) had lower HbA1c and better cardiovascular health at baseline.

However, response to DBS varies, therefore, the ability to predict who will have better outcomes can aid patient selection. Some PD-related monogenic mutations have been reported among factors that influence response to DBS. However, monogenic disease accounts for only a minority of patients with PD. The polygenic risk score (PRS) is an indication of cumulative genetic risk for disease. The PRS in PD has also been correlated with age of onset and symptom progression, but it is unknown whether correlations exist between PRS and DBS response. Here, we performed a pilot study to look for any such correlation. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 33 PD patients from the NIH PD Clinic and 13 patients from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative database who had genetic testing and underwent bilateral subthalamic nucleus DBS surgery and clinical follow-up. A PD-specific PRS was calculated for all 46 patients based on the 90 susceptibility variants identified in the latest PD genome-wide association study. We tested associations between PRS and pre- and post-surgery motor and cognitive measures using multiple regression analysis for up to two years after surgery. Results: Changes in scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were not correlated with PRS when derived from all susceptibility variants, however, when removing pathogenic and high-risk carriers from the calculation, higher PRS was significantly associated with greater reduction in BDI score at 3 months and with similar trend 24 months after DBS. PRS was not a significant predictor of Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale, Dementia Rating Scale, or phenomic and semantic fluency outcomes at 3- and 24-months after DBS surgery. Conclusions: This exploratory study suggests that PRS may predict degree of improvement in depressive symptoms after DBS, though was not predictive of motor and other cognitive outcomes after DBS. Additionally, PRS may be most relevant in predicting DBS outcomes in patients lacking pathogenic or high-risk PD variants. However, this was a small preliminary study and response to DBS treatment is multifactorial, therefore, more standardized high-powered studies are needed.",2,Journal,ar,Article,100,9,9,Deep brain stimulation | Parkinson’s disease | Polygenic risk score,143,14258,NIH,ZIA-NS003154,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,57,NA,NA,37016359

Based on their variable heavy-chain (VH) gene usage, these antibodies can be divided in two groups. One group is encoded by the inherently autoreactive VH4-34 gene segment, derives from anti-DNase1L3 germline-encoded precursors, and gains cross-reactivity to dsDNA – and some additionally to cardiolipin – following somatic hypermutation. The second group, originally defined as nephritogenic anti-dsDNA antibodies, is encoded by diverse VH gene segments. Although affinity maturation results in dual reactivity to DNase1L3 and dsDNA, their binding efficiencies favor DNase1L3 as the primary antigen. Clinical, transcriptional and monoclonal antibody data support that cross-reactive anti-DNase1L3/dsDNA antibodies are more pathogenic than single reactive anti-dsDNA antibodies.

A gelsolin isoform is secreted into the plasma as part of the extracellular actin scavenger system which serves a protective role by digesting and removing actin filaments released from damaged cells. Recent data indicate a role for decreased plasma gelsolin (pGSN) levels as a biomarker of inflammatory conditions. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), a heterogeneous group of cell-derived membranous structures involved in intercellular signaling, have been implicated in metabolic and inflammatory diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus. We examined whether pGSN levels were associated with EV concentration and inflammatory plasma proteins in individuals with or without diabetes. Methods: We quantified pGSN longitudinally (n = 104) in a socioeconomically diverse cohort of middle-aged African American and White study participants with and without diabetes mellitus. Plasma gelsolin levels were assayed by ELISA. EV concentration (sub-cohort n = 40) was measured using nanoparticle tracking analysis. Inflammatory plasma proteins were assayed on the SomaScan® v4 proteomic platform. Results: pGSN levels were lower in men than women. White individuals with diabetes had significantly lower levels of pGSN compared to White individuals without diabetes and to African American individuals either with or without diabetes. For adults living below poverty, those with diabetes had lower pGSN levels than those without diabetes. Adults living above poverty had similar pGSN levels regardless of diabetes status. No correlation between EV concentrations and pGSN levels was identified (r = − 0.03; p = 0.85). Large-scale exploratory plasma protein proteomics revealed 47 proteins that significantly differed by diabetes status, 19 of which significantly correlated with pGSN levels, including adiponectin. Conclusions: In this cohort of racially diverse individuals with and without diabetes, we found differences in pGSN levels with diabetes status, sex, race, and poverty.

The latter demands high-quality human biospecimens, especially in complex disorders in which pathological and specimen heterogeneity, as well as diverse individual clinical profile, often complicate the development of precision therapeutic schemes and patient-tailored treatments. Thus, the collection and characterization of physiologically relevant sEVs are of the utmost importance. However, standard brain EV isolation approaches rely on tissue dissociation, which can contaminate EV fractions with intracellular vesicles. Methods: Based on multiscale analytical platforms such as cryo-EM, label-free proteomics, advanced flow cytometry, and ExoView analyses, we compared and characterized the EV fraction isolated with this novel method with a classical digestion-based EV isolation procedure. Moreover, EV biogenesis was pharmacologically manipulated with either GW4869 or picrotoxin to assess the validity of the spontaneous-release method, while the injection of labelled-EVs into the mouse brain further supported the integrity of the isolated vesicles. Results: We hereby present an efficient purification method that captures a sEV-enriched population spontaneously released by mouse and human brain tissue. In addition, we tested the significance of the release method under conditions where biogenesis/secretion of sEVs was pharmacologically manipulated, as well as under animals’ exposure to chronic stress, a clinically relevant precipitant of brain pathologies, such as depression and Alzheimer’s disease. Our findings show that the released method monitors the drug-evoked inhibition or enhancement of sEVs secretion while chronic stress induces the secretion of brain exosomes accompanied by memory loss and mood deficits suggesting a potential role of sEVs in the brain response to stress and related stress-driven brain pathology. Conclusions: Overall, the spontaneous release method of sEV yield may contribute to the characterization and biomarker profile of physiologically relevant brain-derived sEVs in brain function and pathology.

In this paper, we first report that EC smoking significantly increases the odds of gingival inflammation. Then, through mediation analysis, we seek to identify and explain the mechanism that underlies the relationship between EC smoking and gingival inflammation via the oral microbiome. Methods: We collected saliva and subgingival samples from 75 EC users and 75 non-users between 18 and 34 years in age and profiled their microbial compositions via 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. We conducted raw sequence data processing, denoising and taxonomic annotations using QIIME2 based on the expanded human oral microbiome database (eHOMD). We then created functional annotations (i.e., KEGG pathways) using PICRUSt2. Results: We found significant increases in α-diversity for EC users and disparities in β-diversity between EC users and non-users. We also found significant disparities between EC users and non-users in the relative abundance of 36 microbial taxa in the saliva site and 71 microbial taxa in the subgingival site. Finally, we found that 1 microbial taxon in the saliva site and 18 microbial taxa in the subgingival site significantly mediated the effects of EC smoking on gingival inflammation. The mediators on the genus level, for example, include Actinomyces, Rothia, Neisseria, and Enterococcus in the subgingival site. In addition, we report significant disparities between EC users and non-users in the relative abundance of 71 KEGG pathways in the subgingival site.

Little is known about the factors that contribute to the chronic inflammatory state associated with frailty. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small, membrane-bound vesicles that are released into the circulation and are mediators of intercellular communication. We examined whether mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and inflammatory proteins in EVs may act as damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules in frailty. Results: To address whether EVs and their associated mtDNA and inflammatory protein cargo are altered with frailty, EVs were isolated from non-frail (n = 90) and frail (n = 87) middle-aged (45–55 years) participants from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study. EV concentration was highest in frail White participants. EV mtDNA levels were significantly higher in frail individuals compared to non-frail individuals. The presence of six inflammatory proteins in EVs (FGF-21, HGF, IL-12B, PD-L1, PRDX3, and STAMBP) were significantly associated with frailty. EV inflammatory proteins were significantly altered by frailty status, race, sex, and poverty status. Notably, frail White participants had higher levels of EV-associated CD5, CD8A, CD244, CXCL1, CXCL6, CXCL11, LAP-TGF-beta-1 and MCP-4 compared to frail and non-frail African American participants. Frail White participants living below poverty had higher levels of EV-associated uPA. EV-associated CCL28 levels were highest in non-frail women and CXCL1 were highest in non-frail men. Men living below poverty had higher levels of CD5, CD8A, CXCL1, LAP-TGF-beta-1, and uPA. CXCL6 levels were significantly higher in individuals living above poverty. There was a significant correlation between EV mtDNA levels and the presence of inflammatory proteins. Conclusions: These data suggest that mtDNA within EVs may act as a DAMP molecule in frailty.

All analyses were adjusted for demographic, clinical, lifestyle factors, and use of relevant medications (full adjustment). Multivariate linear regression models were used to assess the association of diabetes characteristics with α diversity and genera abundance, while the association with β diversity was analyzed using permutational multivariate analysis of variance. Statistical significance was set to p-value < 0.05 for α and β diversity analyses and to q-value < 0.1 for genera abundance analyses. Results: There were 16.7% of participants with pre-diabetes, and 14.4% with diabetes (9% diabetes+) with median (interquartile range) diabetes duration of 5 (5–10) years. In the fully adjusted models, compared to those with no diabetes, longer diabetes duration and the diabetes + group had a lower α diversity.

We argue that while many of these interventions have clear potential to improve cognitive health and resilience, large-scale and long-term randomised controlled trials are needed, along with studies utilising washout periods to determine the effects of supplementation cessation, particularly in aged individuals.",6,Journal,re,Review,100,3,3,Ageing | cognition | geroscience | healthspan | interventions | longevity | neurodegeneration,e2,26618,NA,undefined,NA,0,FALSE,NA,NA,70,14623994,NA,36377361

Objective: To investigate the associations of accelerometer-measured sedentary behavior patterns with brain structure and cognition, and further to explore the potential mechanisms. Methods: This community-based study included 2,019 older adults (age≥60 years, 59% women) without dementia derived from participants in the baseline examination of MIND-China (2018-2020). We assessed sedentary parameters using an accelerometer and cognitive function using a neuropsychological test battery. Structural brain markers were assessed on the structural brain MRI scans in a subsample (n = 1,009). Data were analyzed using the general linear, isotemporal substitution, and mediation models. Results: In the total sample (n = 2,019), adjusting for multiple covariates and moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity, longer mean sedentary bout duration was linearly related with lower z-scores of global cognition, verbal fluency, and memory (ptrend < 0.05), whereas greater total sedentary time was linearly associated with lower z-scores of global cognition, verbal fluency, and memory only among individuals with long sedentary time (>10 h/day) (ptrend < 0.05); Breaking up sedentary time with same amount of light-intensity physical activity was significantly associated with higher verbal fluency and memory z-scores (p < 0.05). In the MRI subsample (n = 1,009), separately entering structural brain MRI markers into the mediation models substantially attenuated the associations of mean sedentary bout duration with global cognition, verbal fluency, and memory z-scores.

Our aim was to examine causal and predictive relationships between 4137 serum proteins and incident AF in the prospective population-based Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik (AGES-Reykjavik) study. Methods and results: The study included 4765 participants, of whom 1172 developed AF. Cox proportional hazards regression models were fitted for 4137 baseline protein measurements adjusting for known risk factors. Protein associations were tested for replication in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). Causal relationships were examined in a bidirectional, two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis. The time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)-statistic was examined as protein levels and an AF-polygenic risk score (PRS) were added to clinical risk models. The proteomic signature of incident AF consisted of 76 proteins, of which 63 (83%) were novel and 29 (38%) were replicated in CHS. The signature included both N-Terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)-dependent (e.g. CHST15, ATP1B1, and SVEP1) and independent components (e.g. ASPN, AKR1B, and LAMA1/LAMB1/LAMC1). Nine causal candidates were identified (TAGLN, WARS, CHST15, CHMP3, COL15A1, DUSP13, MANBA, QSOX2, and SRL). The reverse causal analysis suggested that most AF-Associated proteins were affected by the genetic liability to AF. N-Terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide improved the prediction of incident AF events close to baseline with further improvements gained by the AF-PRS at all time points. Conclusion: The AF proteomic signature includes biologically relevant proteins, some of which may be causal. It mainly reflects an NT-proBNP-dependent consequence of the genetic liability to AF.

Our previous studies have demonstrated that SIRT1 binds replication origins and inhibits replication initiation from a group of potential initiation sites (dormant origins). We studied the effects of aging and SIRT1 activity on replication origin usage and the incidence of transcription–replication collisions (creating R-loop structures) in adult human cells obtained at different time points during chronological aging and in cancer cells. In primary, untransformed cells, SIRT1 activity declined and the prevalence of R-loops rose with chronological aging. Both the reduction in SIRT1 activity and the increased abundance of R-loops were also observed during the passage of primary cells in culture. All cells, regardless of donor age or transformation status, reacted to the short-term, acute chemical inhibition of SIRT1 with the activation of excessive replication initiation events coincident with an increased prevalence of R-loops. However, cancer cells activated dormant replication origins, genome-wide, during long-term proliferation with mutated or depleted SIRT1, whereas, in primary cells, the aging-associated SIRT1-mediated activation of dormant origins was restricted to rDNA loci. These observations suggest that chronological aging and the associated decline in SIRT1 activity relax the regulatory networks that protect cells against excess replication and that the mechanisms protecting from replication–transcription collisions at the rDNA loci manifest as differentially enhanced sensitivities to SIRT1 decline and chronological aging.",3,Journal,ar,Article,100,11,11,aging | cancer | chromatin | genomic stability,2630,21100978391,NIH,ZIC AG000615-14,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,74,NA,NA,37998365

Research in African and African admixed populations can enable mapping of complex traits, because of their genetic diversity, extensive population substructure, and distinct linkage disequilibrium patterns. We aimed to do a comprehensive genome-wide assessment in African and African admixed individuals to better understand the genetic architecture of Parkinson's disease in these underserved populations. Methods: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in people of African and African admixed ancestry with and without Parkinson's disease. Individuals were included from several cohorts that were available as a part of the Global Parkinson's Genetics Program, the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium Africa, and 23andMe. A diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was confirmed clinically by a movement disorder specialist for every individual in each cohort, except for 23andMe, in which it was self-reported based on clinical diagnosis. We characterised ancestry-specific risk, differential haplotype structure and admixture, coding and structural genetic variation, and enzymatic activity. Findings: We included 197 918 individuals (1488 cases and 196 430 controls) in our genome-wide analysis. We identified a novel common risk factor for Parkinson's disease (overall meta-analysis odds ratio for risk of Parkinson's disease 1·58 [95% CI 1·37–1·80], p=2·397 × 10−14) and age at onset at the GBA1 locus, rs3115534-G (age at onset β=–2·00 [SE=0·57], p=0·0005, for African ancestry; and β=–4·15 [0·58], p=0·015, for African admixed ancestry), which was rare in non-African or non-African admixed populations. Downstream short-read and long-read whole-genome sequencing analyses did not reveal any coding or structural variant underlying the GWAS signal. The identified signal seems to be associated with decreased glucocerebrosidase activity. Interpretation: Our study identified a novel genetic risk factor in GBA1 in people of African ancestry, which has not been seen in European populations, and it could be a major mechanistic basis of Parkinson's disease in African populations. This population-specific variant exerts substantial risk on Parkinson's disease as compared with common variation identified through GWAS and it was found to be present in 39% of the cases assessed in this study. This finding highlights the importance of understanding ancestry-specific genetic risk in complex diseases, a particularly crucial point as the Parkinson's disease field moves towards targeted treatments in clinical trials. The distinctive genetics of African populations highlights the need for equitable inclusion of ancestrally diverse groups in future trials, which will be a valuable step towards gaining insights into novel genetic determinants underlying the causes of Parkinson's disease.

Senescent cells exhibit cell cycle arrest and secrete a range of proinflammatory factors, termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which promotes tissue dysfunction and exacerbates CVD progression. Omics technologies, specifically transcriptomics and proteomics, offer powerful tools to uncover and define the molecular signatures of senescent cells in cardiovascular tissue. By analyzing the comprehensive molecular profiles of senescent cells, omics approaches can identify specific genetic alterations, gene expression patterns, protein abundances, and metabolite levels associated with senescence in CVD. These omics-based discoveries provide insights into the mechanisms underlying senescence-induced cardiovascular damage, facilitating the development of novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

Can ingestion of milk and milk products lower hip fracture risk for older adults? In this study, older Icelandic adults who were ingesting higher milk had a lower risk of hip fractures. Introduction: This study describes associations between milk intake and hip fracture risk in older Icelanders. The data indicate that no/low milk consumption is related to greater hip fracture risk. Hip fracture can have a severe effect on the life of older adults. Health authorities recommend milk intake for better bone health. However, previous studies addressing this association have been divergent. Methods: This prospective study included 4614 subjects (mean age 76 years) recruited between 2002 and 2006 into the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik (AGES-Reykjavik) study. Information on hip fractures occurring between recruitment and end of follow-up in 2012 was extracted from hospital records. Results: A total of 14% of participants reported milk intake < 0.5 times/day (the lowest category) and 22% of the participants consumed at least milk two times/day (highest category). Milk consumption was positively related to the volumetric bone mineral density at baseline with a sex- and age-adjusted difference of 8.95 ± 2.5 mg/cm3 between the highest compared to lowest milk intake categories (P < 0.001). During the follow-up, 7.4% of participants had a hip fracture, and we observed a decreased risk of incident hip fractures in the highest compared to the lowest milk intake category with a hazard ratio of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.47–0.99) in adjusted model.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed cross-sectional and prospective association analyses of blood-derived mtDNA CN and cardiovascular disease outcomes in 27 316 participants in 8 cohorts of multiple racial and ethnic groups with whole-genome sequencing. We also performed Mendelian randomization to explore causal relationships of mtDNA CN with coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiometabolic risk factors (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia). P<0.01 was used for significance. We validated most of the previously reported associations between mtDNA CN and cardiovascular disease outcomes. For example, 1-SD unit lower level of mtDNA CN was associated with 1.08 (95% CI, 1.04–1.12; P<0.001) times the hazard for developing incident CHD, adjusting for covariates. Mendelian randomization analyses showed no causal effect from a lower level of mtDNA CN to a higher CHD risk (β=0.091; P=0.11) or in the reverse direction (β=−0.012; P=0.076). Additional bidirectional Mendelian randomization analyses revealed that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol had a causal effect on mtDNA CN (β=−0.084; P<0.001), but the reverse direction was not significant (P=0.059). No causal associations were observed between mtDNA CN and obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, in either direction. Multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses showed no causal effect of CHD on mtDNA CN, controlling for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (P=0.52), whereas there was a strong direct causal effect of higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol on lower mtDNA CN, adjusting for CHD status (β=−0.092; P<0.001).

Targeted removal of senescent cells in preclinical models promotes health and longevity, suggesting that the selective elimination of senescent cells is a promising therapeutic approach for mitigating a myriad of age-related pathologies in humans. However, moving senescence-targeting drugs (senotherapeutics) into the clinic will require therapeutic targets and biomarkers, fueled by an improved understanding of the complex and dynamic biology of senescent cell populations and their molecular profiles, as well as the mechanisms underlying the emergence and maintenance of senescence cells and the SASP. Advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomic technologies and workflows have the potential to address these needs. Here, we review the state of translational senescence research and how proteomic approaches have added to our knowledge of senescence biology to date. Further, we lay out a roadmap from fundamental biological discovery to the clinical translation of senotherapeutic approaches through the development and application of emerging proteomic technologies, including targeted and untargeted proteomic approaches, bottom-up and top-down methods, stability proteomics, and surfaceomics.

We aimed to define the optimal healthy ranges of TSH and FT4 based on the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Methods: This systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis identified eligible prospective cohorts through the Thyroid Studies Collaboration, supplemented with a systematic search via Embase, MEDLINE (Ovid), Web of science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar from Jan 1, 2011, to Feb 12, 2017 with an updated search to Oct 13, 2022 (cohorts found in the second search were not included in the IPD). We included cohorts that collected TSH or FT4, and cardiovascular outcomes or mortality for adults (aged ≥18 years). We excluded cohorts that included solely pregnant women, individuals with overt thyroid diseases, and individuals with cardiovascular disease. We contacted the study investigators of eligible cohorts to provide IPD on demographics, TSH, FT4, thyroid peroxidase antibodies, history of cardiovascular disease and risk factors, medication use, cardiovascular disease events, cardiovascular disease mortality, and all-cause mortality. The primary outcome was a composite outcome including cardiovascular disease events (coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure) and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were the separate assessment of cardiovascular disease events, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular disease mortality. We performed one-step (cohort-stratified Cox models) and two-step (random-effects models) meta-analyses adjusting for age, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, and total cholesterol. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42017057576. Findings: We identified 3935 studies, of which 53 cohorts fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 26 cohorts agreed to participate. We included IPD on 134 346 participants with a median age of 59 years (range 18–106) at baseline. There was a J-shaped association of FT4 with the composite outcome and secondary outcomes, with the 20th (median 13·5 pmol/L [IQR 11·2–13·9]) to 40th percentiles (median 14·8 pmol/L [12·3–15·0]) conveying the lowest risk. Compared with the 20–40th percentiles, the age-adjusted and sex-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for FT4 in the 80–100th percentiles was 1·20 (95% CI 1·11–1·31) for the composite outcome, 1·34 (1·20–1·49) for all-cause mortality, 1·57 (1·31–1·89) for cardiovascular disease mortality, and 1·22 (1·11–1·33) for cardiovascular disease events. In individuals aged 70 years and older, the 10-year absolute risk of composite outcome increased over 5% for women with FT4 greater than the 85th percentile (median 17·6 pmol/L [IQR 15·0–18·3]), and men with FT4 greater than the 75th percentile (16·7 pmol/L [14·0–17·4]). Non-linear associations were identified for TSH, with the 60th (median 1·90 mIU/L [IQR 1·68–2·25]) to 80th percentiles (2·90 mIU/L [2·41–3·32]) associated with the lowest risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Compared with the 60–80th percentiles, the age-adjusted and sex-adjusted HR of TSH in the 0–20th percentiles was 1·07 (95% CI 1·02–1·12) for the composite outcome, 1·09 (1·05–1·14) for all-cause mortality, and 1·07 (0·99–1·16) for cardiovascular disease mortality. Interpretation: There was a J-shaped association of FT4 with cardiovascular disease and mortality. Low concentrations of TSH were associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality. The 20–40th percentiles of FT4 and the 60–80th percentiles of TSH could represent the optimal healthy ranges of thyroid function based on the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality, with more than 5% increase of 10-year composite risk identified for FT4 greater than the 85th percentile in women and men older than 70 years.

We hypothesized that higher parity would be associated with increased dementia risk. Materials and Methods: We utilized data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) community-based cohort study. Participants were recruited in 1987–1989 and followed through 2017. Participants, all born between 1921 and 1945, were from four U.S. communities in Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; Minneapolis, MN; and Washington County, MD. We included all female participants seen at ARIC visit three or five for whom parity and dementia outcomes were available (N = 7,921). The primary exposure was self-reported number of live births. Our primary outcome was dementia, diagnosed via neurocognitive assessments, informant interviews, and expert adjudication. We created Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association between parity and incident dementia, adjusting for demographic factors, education level, apolipoprotein E allele status, and vascular risk factors. We tested for interactions by race and birth cohort. Results: The adjusted hazard ratio was 0.82 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.69–0.99) for dementia in women with 0–1 births and 0.85 (95% CI 0.72–0.99) for women with 5+ births, compared to women with 2 births (reference group).

Misfolded and aggregated α-syn has been implicated in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, and Dementia with Lewy Bodies, but less so in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), despite the fact that accumulation of α-syn has been confirmed in over 50% of postmortem brains neuropathologically diagnosed with AD. To date, no therapeutic strategy has effectively or consistently downregulated α-syn in AD. Here we tested the hypothesis that by using a systemically-delivered peptide (ApoB11) bound to a modified antisense oligonucleotide against α-syn (ASO-α-syn), we can downregulate α-syn expression in an AD mouse model and improve behavioral and neuropathologic phenotypes. Our results demonstrate that monthly systemic treatment with of ApoB11:ASO α-syn beginning at 6 months of age reduces expression of α-synuclein in the brains of 9-month-old AD mice. Downregulation of α-syn led to reduction in Aβ plaque burden, prevented neuronal loss and astrogliosis. Furthermore, we found that AD mice treated with ApoB11:ASO α-syn had greatly improved hippocampal and spatial memory function in comparison to their control counterparts.

This often causes undesired contrast variations in the acquired images due to differences in hardware and acquisition parameters. In recent years, image synthesis-based MR harmonization with disentanglement has been proposed to compensate for the undesired contrast variations. The general idea is to disentangle anatomy and contrast information from MR images to achieve cross-site harmonization. Despite the success of existing methods, we argue that major improvements can be made from three aspects. First, most existing methods are built upon the assumption that multi-contrast MR images of the same subject share the same anatomy. This assumption is questionable, since different MR contrasts are specialized to highlight different anatomical features. Second, these methods often require a fixed set of MR contrasts for training (e.g., both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images), limiting their applicability. Lastly, existing methods are generally sensitive to imaging artifacts. In this paper, we present Harmonization with Attention-based Contrast, Anatomy, and Artifact Awareness (HACA3), a novel approach to address these three issues. HACA3 incorporates an anatomy fusion module that accounts for the inherent anatomical differences between MR contrasts. Furthermore, HACA3 can be trained and applied to any combination of MR contrasts and is robust to imaging artifacts. HACA3 is developed and evaluated on diverse MR datasets acquired from 21 sites with varying field strengths, scanner platforms, and acquisition protocols. Experiments show that HACA3 achieves state-of-the-art harmonization performance under multiple image quality metrics. We also demonstrate the versatility and potential clinical impact of HACA3 on downstream tasks including white matter lesion segmentation for people with multiple sclerosis and longitudinal volumetric analyses for normal aging subjects.

Perceived discrimination (defined continuously and using tertiles) was assessed at JHS Exam 1 (2000–2004; mean age ± SD:66.2 ± 5.5) and related to dementia risk through ARIC visit 6 (2017) using covariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Associations of perceived everyday, lifetime, and burden of discrimination with dementia risk were not supported in age-adjusted models or demographic- and cardiovascular health-adjusted models.

Treatment approaches have focused on the suppression, deferral, or dispersion of amyloid-β fibers and plaques. Gene therapy has evolved as a potential therapeutic option for treating Alzheimer's disease, owing to its rapid advancement over the recent decade. Small interfering ribonucleic acid has recently garnered considerable attention in gene therapy owing to its ability to down-regulate genes with high sequence specificity and an almost limitless number of therapeutic targets, including those that were once considered undruggable. However, lackluster cellular uptake and the destabilization of small interfering ribonucleic acid in its biological environment restrict its therapeutic application, necessitating the development of a vector that can safeguard the genetic material from early destruction within the bloodstream while effectively delivering therapeutic genes across the blood-brain barrier. Nanotechnology has emerged as a possible solution, and several delivery systems utilizing nanoparticles have been shown to bypass key challenges regarding small interfering ribonucleic acid delivery. By reducing the enzymatic breakdown of genetic components, nanomaterials as gene carriers have considerably enhanced the efficiency of gene therapy. Liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles, dendrimers, and micelles are examples of nanocarriers that have been designed, and each has its own set of features.

To avoid the complexity of defining patient-specific, private neoepitopes, there has been major interest in targeting common shared mutations in driver genes using off-the-shelf T-cell receptors (TCRs) engineered into autologous lymphocytes. However, identifying the precise naturally processed neoepitopes to pursue is a complex and challenging process. One method to definitively demonstrate whether an epitope is presented at the cell surface is to elute peptides bound to a specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) allele and analyze them by mass spectrometry (MS). These MS data can then be prospectively applied to isolate TCRs specific to the neoepitope. Methods We created mono-allelic cell lines expressing one class I HLA allele and one common mutated oncogene in order to eliminate HLA deconvolution requirements and increase the signal of recovered peptides. MHC-bound peptides on the surface of these cell lines were immunoprecipitated, purified, and analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, producing a list of mutation-containing minimal epitopes. To validate the immunogenicity of these neoepitopes, HLA-transgenic mice were vaccinated using the minimal peptides identified by MS in order to generate neoepitope-reactive TCRs. Specificity of these candidate TCRs was confirmed by peptide titration and recognition of transduced targets. Results We identified precise neoepitopes derived from mutated isoforms of KRAS, EGFR, BRAF, and PIK3CA presented by HLA-A∗03:01 and/or HLA-A∗11:01 across multiple biological replicates. From our MS data, we were able to successfully isolate murine TCRs that specifically recognize four HLA-A∗11:01 restricted neoepitopes (KRAS G13D, PIK3CA E545K, EGFR L858R and BRAF V600E) and three HLA-A∗03:01 restricted neoepitopes (KRAS G12V, EGFR L858R and BRAF V600E). Conclusions Our data show that an MS approach can be used to demonstrate which shared oncogene-derived neoepitopes are processed and presented by common HLA alleles, and those MS data can rapidly be used to develop TCRs against these common tumor-specific antigens.

Objective: To study whether home-based walking exercise improves 6-minute walk (6MW) more than supervised treadmill exercise in people with PAD (defined as Ankle Brachial Index ≤0.90). Data Sources: Data were combined from 5 randomized clinical trials of exercise therapy for PAD using individual participant data meta-analyses, published from 2009 to 2022. Study Selection: Of the 5 clinical trials, 3 clinical trials compared supervised treadmill exercise to nonexercise control (N = 370) and 2 clinical trials compared an effective home-based walking exercise intervention to nonexercise control (N = 349). Data Extraction and Synthesis: Individual participant-level data from 5 randomized clinical trials led by 1 investigative team were combined.

Components of circulating RAS (cRAS) that include precursor angiotensinogen, two critical enzymes (renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme, ACE), their bioactive products, angiotensin- I, II together with its receptors (AT1R and AT2R) essentially determine this homeostasis. Most classical studies, however, showed the deleterious role of cRAS in elevating the blood pressure. Contemporary discovery of non-canonical components of the RAS has challenged this classic hypothesis that it can only exert deleterious effects on the cardiovascular systems. Using the classic cRAS model, we have designed in-silico experiments to test the hypothesis that AT2R-mediated feedback effects play pivotal role for maintaining the normal variation of the mean-arterial pressure (MAP).Beside the AT2R-mediation of downstream singling pathways consisting of several non-canonical RAS components, this study first time illustrated AT2R mediated feedback controls over the blood pressure regulation: one that impedes AT1R activity, and the other that downregulates renin. It has been shown that relatively stronger suppression of renin activity significantly contributes in maintaining the normal MAP and that tight AT2R-mediated regulation is relaxed in hyper-and hypotension. This control mechanism is noted to be robustly maintained with the MAP variations through an established linear steady-state relationship among renin, angiotensin I and angiotensin II. This examination suggests that AT2R-mediated downregulation of renin activities potentially counteracts the AT1R-mediated deleterious actions of Ang II.

Secondary outcomes include total minutes of walking exercise/wk at 12-month follow-up and 12-month change in accelerometer-measured physical activity, the Walking Impairment Questionnaire distance score, and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System mobility questionnaire. Tertiary outcomes include 12-month changes in perceived exertional effort at the end of the 6-minute walk, diet quality, and the Short Physical Performance Battery. Exploratory outcomes include changes in gastrocnemius muscle biopsy measures of mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase activity, mitochondrial biogenesis, capillary density, and inflammatory markers. CONCLUSIONS: The PROVE randomized clinical trial will evaluate the effects of exercise with an intervention of coaching and a smartphone application designed to achieve weight loss, compared with exercise alone, on walking performance in people with PAD and overweight/obesity. Results will inform optimal treatment for the growing number of patients with PAD who have overweight/obesity.

In other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), these biomarkers have also been found to be altered, and the molecular mechanisms responsible for these alterations are still under investigation. Moreover, the interplay between these mechanisms and the diverse underlying disease states remains to be elucidated. Objective: To investigate genetic contributions to the AD biomarkers and assess the commonality and heterogeneity of the associations per underlying disease status. Methods: We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for the AD biomarkers on subjects from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, the Fox Investigation for New Discovery of Biomarkers, and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, and meta-analyzed with the largest AD GWAS. We tested heterogeneity of associations of interest between different disease statuses (AD, PD, and control). Results: We observed three GWAS signals: the APOE locus for amyloid-β, the 3q28 locus between GEMC1 and OSTN for p-tau and t-tau, and the 7p22 locus (top hit: rs60871478, an intronic variant for DNAAF5, also known as HEATR2) for p-tau. The 7p22 locus is novel and colocalized with the brain DNAAF5 expression. Although no heterogeneity from underlying disease status was observed for the earlier GWAS signals, some disease risk loci suggested disease-specific associations with these biomarkers. Conclusions: Our study identified a novel association at the intronic region of DNAAF5 associated with increased levels of p-tau across all diseases.

Investigating the molecular mechanisms of SCV2-host infection vs IAV is vital in exploring antiviral drug targets against SCV2. We assessed differential gene expression in human nasal cells upon SCV2 or IAV infection using RNA sequencing. Compared to IAV, we observed alterations in both metabolic and cytoskeletal pathways suggestive of epithelial remodeling in the SCV2-infected cells, reminiscent of pathways activated as a response to chronic injury. We found that spike protein interaction with the epithelium was sufficient to instigate these epithelial responses using a SCV2 spike pseudovirus. Specifically, we found downregulation of the mitochondrial markers SIRT3 and TOMM22. Moreover, SCV2 spike infection increased extracellular acidification and decreased oxygen consumption rate in the epithelium. In addition, we observed cytoskeletal rearrangements with a reduction in the actin-severing protein cofilin-1 and an increase in polymerized actin, indicating epithelial cytoskeletal rearrangements. This study revealed distinct epithelial responses to SCV2 infection, with early mitochondrial dysfunction in the host cells and evidence of cytoskeletal remodeling that could contribute to the worsened outcome in COVID-19 patients compared to IAV patients. These changes in cell structure and energetics could contribute to cellular resilience early during infection, allowing for prolonged cell survival and potentially paving the way for more chronic symptoms. IMPORTANCE COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic affecting millions of people worldwide, resulting in a higher mortality rate and concerns of more persistent symptoms compared to influenza A. To study this, we compare lung epithelial responses to both viruses. Interestingly, we found that in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cellular energetics changed and there were cell structural rearrangements. These changes in cell structure could lead to prolonged epithelial cell survival, even in the face of not working well, potentially contributing to the development of chronic symptoms. In summary, these findings represent strategies utilized by the cell to survive the infection but result in a fundamental shift in the epithelial phenotype, with potential long-term consequences, which could set the stage for the development of chronic lung disease or long COVID-19.",9,Journal,ar,Article,100,17,17,actin | bioenergetics | COVID-19 | cytoskeleton | lung epithelia | SARS-CoV-2,NA,19700188403,HHS,5U01ES026721,Honeywell Hometown Solutions,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,155,NA,e0082023,37504520

Few studies have examined exposure to individual volatile hydrocarbon chemicals below occupational exposure limits in relation to neurologic function among OSRC workers. Objectives: To investigate the association of several spill-related chemicals (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, n-hexane, i.e., BTEX-H) and total petroleum hydrocarbons (THC) with neurologic function among DWH spill workers enrolled in the Gulf Long-term Follow-up Study. Methods: Cumulative exposure to THC and BTEX-H across the oil spill cleanup period were estimated using a job-exposure matrix that linked air measurement data to detailed self-reported DWH OSRC work histories. We ascertained quantitative neurologic function data via a comprehensive test battery at a clinical examination that occurred 4–6 years after the DWH disaster. We used multivariable linear regression and modified Poisson regression to evaluate relationships of exposures (quartiles (Q)) with 4 neurologic function measures. We examined modification of the associations by age at enrollment (<50 vs. ≥50 years). Results: We did not find evidence of adverse neurologic effects from crude oil exposures among the overall study population. However, among workers ≥50 years of age, several individual chemical exposures were associated with poorer vibrotactile acuity of the great toe, with statistically significant effects observed in Q3 or Q4 of exposures (range of log mean difference in Q4 across exposures: 0.13–0.26 μm). We also observed suggestive adverse associations among those ≥ age 50 years for tests of postural stability and single-leg stance, although most effect estimates did not reach thresholds of statistical significance (p < 0.05).

The inability to activate a timely and adequate response can lead to disease and is a hallmark of aging. Besides protein-coding genes, cells contain a plethora of noncoding regulatory elements that allow cells to respond rapidly and efficiently to external stimuli by activating highly specific and tightly controlled mechanisms. Many of these programs converge on the regulation of translation, one of the most energy-consuming processes in cells. Recent Advances: The noncoding dimension of translational regulation includes short and long noncoding ribonucleic acids (ncRNAs), as well as messenger RNA features, such as the sequence and modification status of the 5¢ and 3¢ untranslated regions (UTRs), that do not change the amino acid sequence of the produced protein. Critical Issues: In this review, we discuss the regulatory role of the nonprotein-coding components of translation under stress, particularly oxidative stress. We conclude that the regulation of translation through ncRNAs, UTRs, and nucleotide modifications is emerging as a critical component of the stress response.

Understanding the relationship between white matter integrity, especially myelination, and motor function is crucial to the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. We recruited 118 cognitively unimpaired adults across an extended age range of 22–94 years to examine associations between rapid or usual gait speeds and cerebral myelin content. Using our advanced multicomponent magnetic resonance relaxometry method, we measured myelin water fraction (MWF), a direct measure of myelin content, as well as longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates (R1 and R2), sensitive but nonspecific magnetic resonance imaging measures of myelin content. After adjusting for covariates and excluding 22 data sets due to cognitive impairments or artifacts, our results indicate that participants with higher rapid gait speed exhibited higher MWF, R1, and R2 values, that is, higher myelin content. These associations were statistically significant within several white matter brain regions, particularly the frontal and parietal lobes, splenium, anterior corona radiata, and superior fronto-occipital and longitudinal fasciculus. In contrast, we did not find any significant associations between usual gait speed and MWF, R1, or R2, which suggests that rapid gait speed may be a more sensitive marker of demyelination than usual gait speed.

Physical function, reflecting healthy longevity rather than just longevity, is more relevant to the goals of geroscience but has not been well investigated. Methods: We tested the association of midlife Dm and its change over ~20 years with physical function in later life in 5 583 the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study cohort participants (baseline mean age 54.7). Dm quantifies the multivariate statistical deviation of 17 physiologically motivated biomarkers relative to their distribution in a young healthy sample at baseline. Physical function was assessed from grip strength and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Associations were quantified using linear regression and ordinal logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, race, and education. Results: Each unit increment in midlife Dm was associated with 1.71 times the odds of having a lower SPPB score. Compared to the first quartile of midlife Dm, the odds ratios of having a lower SPPB score were 1.25, 1.56, and 2.45, respectively, for the second–fourth quartiles. Similar graded association patterns were observed for each SPPB component test and grip strength.

Guidelines recommend titration from a low starting dose for older adults with hypothyroidism while providing weight-based estimates for younger populations. However, rapid replacement may be appropriate with acute onset of overt hypothyroidism. Therefore, a weight-based recommendation specific to older adults is needed. Methods: We determined mean levothyroxine dose using actual and ideal body weight (IBW) ratios for the outcome of euthyroid on therapy relative to assay-specific and proposed age-specific ranges for independently living participants aged ≥65 years in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. We examined risk factors to identify those at highest risk of overtreatment using regression analyses adjusted for potential covariables and clustering to account for multiple visits per individual.

Finally, clustering profiles of identical contextualized explanations reveal different aging trajectories opening opportunities to specific clinical follow-up.

Results: Of 296 participants, 52.7% had isolated olfactory dysfunction, 7.4% had isolated balance dysfunction, and 5.7% had dual dysfunction. Severe olfactory dysfunction was associated with increased odds of balance dysfunction when compared to those without olfactory dysfunction, even when adjusting for age, gender, race, education, BMI, smoking, diabetes, depression, and dementia (OR = 4.1, 95% CI [1.5, 13.7], p = 0.011).

Metabolites differentially abundant were enriched for lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPC C18:0,C16:0,C17:0,C18:1,C18:2), ceramides (d18:2/24:0,d16:1/24:0,d16:1/23:0), and amino acids (glycine) classes. Compared to no decline, the dual decline group showed greater declines in lysoPC C18:0, homoarginine synthesis, and the metabolite module containing mostly triglycerides, and showed a greater increase in indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity. Metabolites distinguishing dual decline and no decline groups were implicated in metabolic pathways of the aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, histidine metabolism, and sphingolipid metabolism. Older adults with dual decline exhibit the most extensive alterations in metabolic profiling of lysoPCs, ceramides, IDO activity, and homoarginine synthesis.

The molecular mechanisms of skeletal muscle aging are not well understood. To better understand mechanisms of muscle aging, we investigated the potential role of ATF4, a transcription regulatory protein that can rapidly promote skeletal muscle atrophy in young animals deprived of adequate nutrition or activity. To test the hypothesis that ATF4 may be involved in skeletal muscle aging, we studied fed and active muscle-specific ATF4 knockout mice (ATF4 mKO mice) at 6 months of age, when wild-type mice have achieved peak muscle mass and function, and at 22 months of age, when wild-type mice have begun to manifest age-related muscle atrophy and weakness. We found that 6-month-old ATF4 mKO mice develop normally and are phenotypically indistinguishable from 6-month-old littermate control mice. However, as ATF4 mKO mice become older, they exhibit significant protection from age-related declines in strength, muscle quality, exercise capacity, and muscle mass. Furthermore, ATF4 mKO muscles are protected from some of the transcriptional changes characteristic of normal muscle aging (repression of certain anabolic mRNAs and induction of certain senescence-associated mRNAs), and ATF4 mKO muscles exhibit altered turnover of several proteins with important roles in skeletal muscle structure and metabolism. Collectively, these data suggest ATF4 as an essential mediator of skeletal muscle aging and provide new insight into a degenerative process that impairs the health and quality of life of many older adults.",16,Journal,ar,Article,100,14,14,Aging | ATF4 | Protein turnover | Sarcopenia | Skeletal muscle | Skeletal muscle atrophy,NA,21100805354,NIH,R01AG060637,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,179,25092715,2525-2543,37014538

Controls were 766 Italian participants age-matched, sex-matched, and geographically matched to cases.

ResultsThe median survival time of the whole cohort was 2.67 years (interquartile range [IQR] 1.67-5.25). In univariate analysis, only C9orf72 (2.51 years, IQR 1.74-3.82; p = 0.016), ATXN2 (1.82 years, IQR 1.08-2.33; p < 0.001), and UNC13AC/C(2.3 years, IQR 1.3-3.9; p < 0.001) significantly reduced survival. In Cox multivariable analysis, CAMTA1 also emerged to be independently related to survival (hazard ratio 1.13, 95% CI 1.001-1.30, p = 0.048). The copresence of 2 detrimental alleles/expansions was correlated with shorter survival. In particular, the median survival of patients with CAMTA1G/G+G/Tand UNC13AC/Calleles was 1.67 years (1.16-3.08) compared with 2.75 years (1.67-5.26) of the patients not carrying these variants (p < 0.001); the survival of patients with CAMTA1G/G+G/Talleles and ATXN2≥31intermediate polyQ repeats was 1.75 years (0.84-2.18) (p < 0.001); the survival of patients with ATXN2≥31polyQ repeats and UNC13AC/Callele was 1.33 years (0.84-1.75) (p < 0.001); the survival of patients with C9ORF72≥30and UNC13AC/Callele was 1.66 years (1.41-2.16).

First, we transform the image appearance from MR to CT with CycleGAN and feed the synthesized CT images to a segmenter simultaneously. Single CT slices are divided into hard and easy cohorts based on the entropy of pseudo-labels predicted by the segmenter. After refining easy cohort pseudo-labels based on anatomical assumption, self-training with easy and hard splits is applied to fine-tune the segmenter.

However, its role in T-cell survival and its underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that acetate modulates T-cell apoptosis via potentiation of α-tubulin acetylation. We further show that acetate treatment effectively increases the expression of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family member CD30 by enhancing its gene transcription. Moreover, CD30 physically associates with and stabilizes the deacetylase HDAC6, which deacetylates α-tubulin to decrease microtubule stability. Proteomic profiling of CD30 knockout (Cd30–/–) T-cells reveals elevated expression of anti-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins and thus promotes T-cell survival via a microtubule-Bcl-2 axis. Taken together, our results demonstrate that acetate is a regulator of T-cell survival by controlling levels of acetylated α-tubulin.

Age-associated chronic inflammation and generation of reactive oxygen species exacerbate the aging process and age-related chronic disorders. These inflammatory processes establish conditions that favor accumulation of DNA base damage, especially 8-oxo-7,8 di-hydroguanine (8-oxoG), which in turn contributes to various age associated diseases. 8-oxoG is repaired by 8-oxoG glycosylase1 (OGG1) through the base excision repair (BER) pathway. OGG1 is present in both the cell nucleus and in mitochondria. Mitochondrial OGG1 has been implicated in mitochondrial DNA repair and increased mitochondrial function. Using transgenic mouse models and cell lines that have been engineered to have enhanced expression of mitochondria-targeted OGG1 (mtOGG1), we show that elevated levels of mtOGG1 in mitochondria can reverse aging-associated inflammation and improve functions. Old male mtOGG1Tg mice show decreased inflammation response, decreased TNFα levels and multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, we observe that male mtOGG1Tg mice show resistance to STING activation. Interestingly, female mtOGG1Tg mice did not respond to mtOGG1 overexpression. Further, HMC3 cells expressing mtOGG1 display decreased release of mtDNA into the cytoplasm after lipopolysacchride induction and regulate inflammation through the pSTING pathway.

In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide), via a cGMP/PKG1 (protein kinase G1)-dependent mechanism, reduces NKA sensitivity to marinobufagenin. We hypothesized that VSMC from old rats, due to downregulation of ANP/cGMP/PKG-dependent signaling, would exhibit heightened sensitivity to the profibrotic effect of marinobufagenin. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cultured VSMC from the young (3-month-old) and old (24-month-old) male Sprague–Dawley rats and young VSMC with silenced PKG1 gene were treated with 1 nmol/L ANP, or with 1 nmol/L marinobufagenin, or with a combination of ANP and marinobufagenin. Collagen-1, Fli1, and PKG1 levels were assessed by Western blotting analyses. Vascular PKG1 and Fli1 levels in the old rats were reduced compared with their young counterparts. ANP prevented inhibition of vascular NKA by marinobufagenin in young VSMC but not in old VSMC. In VSMC from the young rats, marinobufagenin induced downregulation of Fli1 and an increase in collagen-1 level, whereas ANP blocked this effect. Silencing of the PKG1 gene in young VSMC resulted in a reduction in levels of PKG1 and Fli1; marinobufagenin additionally reduced Fli1 and increased collagen-1 level, and ANP failed to oppose these marinobufagenin effects, similar to VSMC from the old rats with the age-associated reduction in PKG1. CONCLUSIONS: Age-associated reduction in vascular PKG1 and the resultant decline in cGMP signaling lead to the loss of the ability of ANP to oppose marinobufagenin-induced inhibition of NKA and fibrosis development.

Here, we report increased levels and activity of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), a serine protease, in senescent VSMCs. Analysis of the conditioned media from senescent VSMCs revealed a unique senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) signature comprising many complement and coagulation factors; silencing or inhibiting DPP4 reduced these factors and increased cell death. Serum samples from persons with high risk for cardiovascular disease contained high levels of DPP4-regulated complement and coagulation factors. Importantly, DPP4 inhibition reduced senescent cell burden and coagulation and improved plaque stability, while single-cell resolution of senescent VSMCs reflected the senomorphic and senolytic effects of DPP4 inhibition in murine atherosclerosis.

While Fos is often used to label selectively activated cell bodies and identify neuronal ensembles, there is no comparable endogenous marker to label activated synapses and identify synaptic ensembles. For the purpose of identifying candidate synaptic activity markers, we optimized a flow cytometry of synaptoneurosome (FCS) procedure for assessing protein alterations in activated synapses from male and female rats. After injecting yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-expressing adeno-associated virus into medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to label terminals in nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rats, we injected 20mg/kg cocaine in a novel context (cocaine1novelty) to activate synapses, and prepared NAc synaptoneurosomes 0–60min following injections. For FCS, we used commercially available antibodies to label presynaptic and postsynaptic markers synaptophysin and PSD-95 as well as candidate markers of synaptic activity [activity-regulated cytoskeleton protein (Arc), CaMKII and phospho-CaMKII, ribosomal protein S6 (S6) and phospho-S6, and calcineurin and phospho-calcineurin] in YFP-labeled synaptoneurosomes. Cocaine1novelty increased the percentage of S6-positive synaptoneurosomes at 5–60min and calcineurin-positive synaptoneurosomes at 5–10min. Electron microscopy verified that S6 and calcineurin levels in synaptoneurosomes were increased 10min after cocaine1novelty. Pretreatment with the anesthetic chloral hydrate blocked cocaine1novelty-induced S6 and calcineurin increases in synaptoneurosomes, and novel context exposure alone (without cocaine) increased S6, both of which indicate that these increases were due to neural activity per se.

They create exposure to physical, chemical, biological, and psychosocial hazards while simultaneously exploiting community and individual-level vulnerabilities that allow such exposures to exert harm. Since 2013, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) has led the development of the Disaster Research Response (DR2) program and infrastructure; however, research exploring the nature and effects of disasters on human health is lacking. One reason for this research gap is the challenge of developing and deploying cost-effective sensors for exposure assessment during disaster events. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this commentary is to synergize the consensus findings and recommendations from a panel of experts on sensor science in support of DR2. METHODS: The NIEHS convened the workshop, “Getting Smart about Sensors for Disaster Response Research” on 28 and 29 July 2021 to discuss current gaps and recommendations for moving the field forward. The workshop invited full discussion from multiple viewpoints, with the goal of identifying recommendations and opportunities for further development of this area of research. The panel of experts included leaders in engineering, epidemiology, social and physical sciences, and community engagement, many of whom had firsthand experience with DR2. DISCUSSION: The primary finding of this workshop is that exposure science in support of DR2 is severely lacking. We highlight unique barriers to DR2, such as the need for time-sensitive exposure data, the chaos and logistical challenges that ensue from a disaster event, and the lack of a robust market for sensor technologies in support of environmental health science. We highlight a need for sensor technologies that are more scalable, reli-able, and versatile than those currently available to the research community. We also recommend that the environmental health community renew efforts in support of DR2 facilitation, collaboration, and preparedness. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12270.",5,Journal,no,Note,100,14,14,NA,065002,21003,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,210,00916765,NA,37389972

Results: Mobility disability associated with aging and chronic diseases is an attractive indication because it is recognized by geriatricians as a common condition associated with adverse outcomes, and it can be ascertained reliably. Other conditions associated with functional limitation in older adults include hospitalization for acute illnesses, cancer cachexia, and fall injuries. Efforts are underway to harmonize definitions of sarcopenia and frailty.

An accurate measure of muscle mass (eg, D3 creatine dilution) could be a good biomarker in early-phase trials. Performance-based and patient-reported measures of physical function are needed to demonstrate whether treatment improves how a person lives, functions, or feels. Multicomponent functional training that integrates training in balance, stability, strength, and functional tasks with cognitive and behavioral strategies may be needed to translate drug-induced muscle mass gains into functional improvements.

We screened the hepatic transcriptome and found that CUR supplementation led to the downregulation of senescence-associated hepatic gene expressions in both usually fed and nutritionally challenged aged mice. Our results showed that CUR supplementation enhanced antioxidant properties and suppressed mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades in the liver, particularly c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in aged mice and p38 in diet-induced obese aged mice. Furthermore, dietary CUR decreased the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), a downstream transcription factor of JNK and p38, and inhibited the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines and SASPs.

The trial also showed that targeted dietary manipulation alters PUFA-derived lipid mediators and endocannabinoids. However, several additional classes of lipid mediators associated with pain in preclinical models were not measured. The current secondary analysis investigated whether the clinical benefits of the H3-L6 diet were related to changes in plasma unesterified PUFA-derived lipid mediators known to be involved in nociception, including prostanoids. Lipid mediators were measured by ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass-spectrometry. Compared to baseline, dietary LA lowering with or without added omega-3 fatty acids did not alter unesterified n-6 PUFA-derived lipid mediators, although several species derived from LA, di-homo-gamma-linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid were positively associated with headache frequency and intensity, as well as mental health burden. Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)-derived metabolites were also associated with increased headache frequency and intensity, although they did not change from the baseline in either dietary group. Compared to baseline, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-derived epoxides were more elevated in the H3-L6 group compared to the L6 group. Diet-induced elevations in plasma DHA-epoxides were associated with reduced headache frequency, better physical and mental health, and improved quality of life (p < 0.05). Prostanoids were not detected, except for PGF2-alpha, which was not associated with any outcomes. This study demonstrates that diet-induced changes in DHA-epoxides were associated with pain reduction in patients with chronic headaches, whereas n-6 PUFA and ALA metabolites were associated with nociception.

Methods: Cross-sectional analysis was performed on three cohort studies: the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA); the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study (HABC Study) and the I'm Still Standing Study (ISS Study); (n = 1173, n = 162, n = 125; age range: 57–99, 85–95, 80–100 years; women: 51%, 56%, 61%, respectively). Physical activity and sedentary behavior were measured using hip-worn (LASA and HABC) and wrist-worn (ISS) accelerometers. Appetite was self-reported. Logistic regression models were fitted by accelerometer placement to explore the association between good appetite and various physical activity metrics (total activity, sedentary behavior, and time spent in different intensities of physical activity). Results: Among cohorts using hip-worn accelerometers, those having total activity within the highest tertile had more than double the odds of having good appetite compared with those within the lowest tertile (odds ratio [OR] 2.16 (1.15–4.06)). Each additional percent of daily sedentary behavior decreased the odds for having good appetite by 3% (OR 0.97 (0.95–0.996)), while each additional percent of daily light-intensity physical activity increased the odds for having good appetite by 4% (OR 1.02 (1.01–1.06)). No association was found between either physical activity or sedentary behavior and appetite for measurements with the wrist-worn accelerometers. Conclusions: Among community-dwelling older adults, the associations between appetite, accelerometer-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior differ by accelerometer placement location.

Objectives: We used data from a multi-site, international, prospective cohort study to explore the impact of dopamine system-related biomarkers on CI in PD. Methods: PD participants were assessed annually from disease onset out to 7 years, and CI determined by applying cut-offs to four measures: (1) Montreal Cognitive Assessment; (2) detailed neuropsychological test battery; (3) Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) cognition score; and (4) site investigator diagnosis of CI (mild cognitive impairment or dementia). The dopamine system was assessed by serial Iodine-123 Ioflupane dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging, genotyping, and levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) recorded at each assessment. Multivariate longitudinal analyses, with adjustment for multiple comparisons, determined the association between dopamine system-related biomarkers and CI, including persistent impairment. Results: Demographic and clinical variables associated with CI were higher age, male sex, lower education, non-White race, higher depression and anxiety scores and higher MDS-UPDRS motor score. For the dopamine system, lower baseline mean striatum dopamine transporter values (P range 0.003–0.005) and higher LEDD over time (P range <0.001–0.01) were significantly associated with increased risk for CI. Conclusions: Our results provide preliminary evidence that alterations in the dopamine system predict development of clinically-relevant, cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease. If replicated and determined to be causative, they demonstrate that the dopamine system is instrumental to cognitive health status throughout the disease course.

Therefore, maintenance of protein homeostasis, proteostasis, including prevention of protein misfolding is essential for cellular activity and health. Molecular chaperones are key actors in proteostasis. BRICHOS domain is an intramolecular chaperone that also interferes with several aggregation-prone proteins including amyloid β (Aβ), involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To extend the knowledge about Bri2 BRICHOS interactome we here used recombinant human (rh) Bri2 BRICHOS-mCherry fusion protein to probe for potential binding partners. Firstly, exogenously added Bri2 BRICHOS-mCherry was used to stain brain sections of wildtype and amyloid precursor protein (App) knock-in AD mice exhibiting robust Aβ pathology. Unexpectedly, we found that rh Bri2 BRICHOS-mCherry stained the cytoplasm of neurons which are devoid of Aβ deposits. To identify these intraneuronal proteins that bind to the rh Bri2 BRICHOS domain, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of mouse brain hippocampi homogenates using the Bri2 BRICHOS-mCherry probe and analyzed co-IP proteins by LC-MS/MS.

Results: Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses suggested activation of hypoxia-compensatory mechanisms in PAD muscle, including inflammation, fibrosis, apoptosis, angiogenesis, unfolded protein response, and nerve and muscle repair. Stoichiometric proportions of mitochondrial respiratory proteins were aberrant in PAD compared to non-PAD, suggesting that respiratory proteins not in complete functional units are not removed by mitophagy, likely contributing to abnormal mitochondrial activity. Supporting this hypothesis, greater mitochondrial respiratory protein abundance was significantly associated with greater complex II and complex IV respiratory activity in non-PAD but not in PAD. Rate-limiting glycolytic enzymes, such as hexokinase and pyruvate kinase, were less abundant in muscle of people with PAD compared with non-PAD participants, suggesting diminished glucose metabolism.

At the local level, site-specific loss of H3K27me3 over promoters of genes encoding developmental transcription factors leads to expression of otherwise non-hepatocyte markers.

We investigated cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between cerebellar volume and verbal learning and memory. Linear mixed effects models and partial correlations were used to examine the relationship between changes in cerebellum volumes (total cerebellum, cerebellum white matter [WM], cerebellum hemisphere gray matter [GM], and cerebellum vermis subregions) and changes in verbal learning and memory performance among 549 Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants (2,292 visits). All models were adjusted by baseline demographic characteristics (age, sex, race, education), and APOE e4 carrier status. In examining associations between change with change, we tested an additional model that included either hippocampal (HC), cuneus, or postcentral gyrus (PoCG) volumes to assess whether cerebellar volumes were uniquely associated with verbal learning and memory. Cross-sectionally, the association of baseline cerebellum GM and WM with baseline verbal learning and memory was age-dependent, with the oldest individuals showing the strongest association between volume and performance. Baseline volume was not significantly associated with change in learning and memory. However, analysis of associations between change in volumes and changes in verbal learning and memory showed that greater declines in verbal memory were associated with greater volume loss in cerebellum white matter, and preserved GM volume in cerebellum vermis lobules VI-VII.

However, whether mtDNA CN in whole blood is related to endophenotypes of Alzheimer disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (AD/ADRD) needs further investigation. We assessed the association of mtDNA CN with cognitive function and MRI measures in community-based samples of middle-aged to older adults.MethodsWe included dementia-free participants from 9 diverse community-based cohorts with whole-genome sequencing in the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program. Circulating mtDNA CN was estimated as twice the ratio of the average coverage of mtDNA to nuclear DNA. Brain MRI markers included total brain, hippocampal, and white matter hyperintensity volumes. General cognitive function was derived from distinct cognitive domains. We performed cohort-specific association analyses of mtDNA CN with AD/ADRD endophenotypes assessed within ±5 years (i.e., cross-sectional analyses) or 5-20 years after blood draw (i.e., prospective analyses) adjusting for potential confounders. We further explored associations stratified by sex and age (<60 vs ≥60 years). Fixed-effects or sample size-weighted meta-analyses were performed to combine results. Finally, we performed mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to assess causality.ResultsWe included up to 19,152 participants (mean age 59 years, 57% women).

However, to our knowledge, no study has examined exposure to individual oil spill–related chemicals in relation to cardiovascular outcomes among oil spill workers. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to investigate the association of several spill-related chemicals [benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, n-hexane (BTEX-H)] and total hydrocarbons (THC) with incident coronary heart disease (CHD) events among workers enrolled in a prospective cohort. METHODS: Cumulative exposures to THC and BTEX-H across the cleanup period were estimated via a job-exposure matrix that linked air measure-ment data with self-reported DWH spill work histories. We ascertained CHD events following each worker’s last day of cleanup work as the first self-reported physician-diagnosed myocardial infarction (MI) or a fatal CHD event. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals for the associations of exposure quintiles (Q) with risk of CHD. We applied inverse probability weights to account for bias due to confounding and loss to follow-up. We used quantile g-computation to assess the joint effect of the BTEX-H mixture. RESULTS: Among 22,655 workers with no previous MI diagnoses, 509 experienced an incident CHD event through December 2019. Workers in higher quintiles of each exposure agent had increased CHD risks in comparison with the referent group (Q1) of that agent, with the strongest associations observed in Q5 (range of HR = 1:14–1:44). However, most associations were nonsignificant, and there was no evidence of exposure–response trends. We observed stronger associations among ever smokers, workers with ≤high school education, and workers with body mass index <30 kg/m2. No apparent positive association was observed for the BTEX-H mixture. CONCLUSIONS: Higher exposures to volatile components of crude oil were associated with modest increases in risk of CHD among oil spill workers, although we did not observe exposure–response trends. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11859.",9,Journal,ar,Article,100,17,17,NA,057006,21003,DMS,1513654,Division of Mathematical Sciences,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,244,00916765,NA,37224072

We identified and quantified the direct afferent inputs to these adult-born neurons within the hippocampus and (sub)cortical areas. Here, we show that long-term running substantially modifies the network of the neurons generated in young adult mice, upon middle-age. Exercise increases input from hippocampal interneurons onto “old” adult-born neurons, which may play a role in re-ducing aging-related hippocampal hyperexcitability. In addition, running prevents the loss of adult-born neuron innervation from perirhinal cortex, and increases input from subiculum and entorhinal cortex, brain areas that are essential for contextual and spatial memory.

GALC encodes the lysosomal enzyme galactosylceramidase, which plays a pivotal role in the glycosphingolipid metabolism pathway. It is still unclear whether GALC is the gene driving the association in the chromosome 14 locus and, if so, by which mechanism. We first aimed to examine whether variants in the GALC locus and across the genome are associated with galactosylceramidase activity. We performed a genome-wide association study in two independent cohorts from (i) Columbia University; and (ii) the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative study, followed by a meta-analysis with a total of 976 PD patients and 478 controls with available data on galactosylceramidase activity. We further analysed the effects of common GALC variants on expression and galactosylceramidase activity using genomic colocalization methods. Mendelian randomization was used to study whether galactosylceramidase activity may be causal in PD. To study the role of rare GALC variants, we analysed sequencing data from 5028 PD patients and 5422 controls. Additionally, we studied the functional impact of GALC knockout on alpha-synuclein accumulation and on glucocerebrosidase activity in neuronal cell models and performed in silico structural analysis of common GALC variants associated with altered galactosylceramidase activity. The top hit in PD genome-wide association study in the GALC locus, rs979812, is associated with increased galactosylceramidase activity (b = 1.2; SE = 0.06; P = 5.10 × 10−95). No other variants outside the GALC locus were associated with galactosylceramidase activity. Colocalization analysis demonstrated that rs979812 was also associated with increased galactosylceramidase expression. Mendelian randomization suggested that increased galactosylceramidase activity may be causally associated with PD (b = 0.025, SE = 0.007, P = 0.0008). We did not find an association between rare GALC variants and PD. GALC knockout using CRISPR–Cas9 did not lead to alpha-synuclein accumulation, further supporting that increased rather than reduced galactosylceramidase levels may be associated with PD. The structural analysis demonstrated that the common variant p.I562T may lead to improper maturation of galactosylceramidase affecting its activity. Our results nominate GALC as the gene associated with PD in this locus and suggest that the association of variants in the GALC locus may be driven by their effect of increasing galactosylceramidase expression and activity.

This has raised the question: what are the structural features of a chromosome required for its inclusion in a nucleolus? Previous work has suggested that sequences adjacent to the tandemly repeated rDNA repeat units (DJ, distal junction sequence) may be involved, and we have extended such studies by addressing several issues related to the requirements for the association of NORs with nucleoli. We exploited both a set of somatic cell hybrids containing individual human acrocentric chromosomes and a set of Human Artificial Chromosomes (HACs) carrying different parts of a NOR, including an rDNA unit or DJ or PJ (proximal junction) sequence. Association of NORs with nucleoli was increased when constituent rDNA was transcribed and may be also affected by the status of heterochromatin blocks formed next to the rDNA arrays. Furthermore, our data suggest that a relatively small size DJ region, highly conserved in evolution, is also involved, along with the rDNA repeats, in the localization of p-arms of acrocentric chromosomes in nucleoli. Thus, we infer a cooperative action of rDNA sequence—stimulated by its activity—and sequences distal to rDNA contributing to incorporation into nucleoli. Analysis of NOR sequences also identified LncRNA_038958 in the DJ, a candidate transcript with the region of the suggested promoter that is located close to the DJ/rDNA boundary and contains CTCF binding sites. This LncRNA may affect RNA Polymerase I and/or nucleolar activity.

In human cells, there are five RecQ helicases: RECQL1, Bloom syndrome (BLM), Werner syndrome (WRN), RECQL4, and RECQL5. Dysfunction or absence of RecQ proteins is associated with genetic disorders, tumorigenesis, premature aging, and neurodegeneration. The biochemical and biological roles of RecQ helicases are rather well established, however, there is no systematic study comparing the behavioral changes among various RecQ-deficient mice including consequences of exposure to DNA damage. Here, we investigated the effects of ionizing irradiation (IR) on three RecQ-deficient mouse models (RecQ1, WRN and RecQ4). We find abnormal cognitive behavior in RecQ-deficient mice in the absence of IR. Interestingly, RecQ dysfunction impairs social ability and induces depressive-like behavior in mice after a single exposure to IR, suggesting that RecQ proteins play roles in mood and cognition behavior. Further, transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed significant alterations in RecQ-deficient mice, especially after IR exposure. In particular, pathways related to neuronal and microglial functions, DNA damage repair, cell cycle, and reactive oxygen responses were downregulated in the RecQ4 and WRN mice. In addition, increased DNA damage responses were found in RecQ-deficient mice. Notably, two genes, Aldolase Fructose-Bisphosphate B (Aldob) and NADPH Oxidase 4 (Nox4), were differentially expressed in RecQ-deficient mice.

Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the contribution of PD risk variants to risk for PD in patients with GD1. Methods: We studied 225 patients with GD1, including 199 without PD and 26 with PD. All cases were genotyped, and the genetic data were imputed using common pipelines.

RDW increases with age and has been consistently associated with adverse health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease and mortality. Why RDW increases with age is not understood. We aimed to identify plasma metabolomic markers mediating anisocytosis with aging. Methods: We performed mediation analyses of plasma metabolomics on the association between age and RDW using resampling techniques after covariate adjustment. We analyzed data from adults aged 70 or older from the main discovery cohort of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA, n = 477, 46% women) and validation cohorts of the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study (Health ABC, n = 620, 52% women) and Invecchiare in Chianti, Aging in the Chianti Area (InCHIANTI) study (n = 735, 57% women).

Consequently, causal variants for most PD risk are not known. Here we focused on structural variants (SVs), which represent a major source of genetic variation in the human genome. We aimed to discover SVs associated with PD risk by performing the first large-scale characterization of SVs in PD. Methods: We leveraged a recently developed computational pipeline to detect and genotype SVs from 7,772 Illumina short-read whole genome sequencing samples. Using this set of SV variants, we performed a genome-wide association study using 2,585 cases and 2,779 controls and identified SVs associated with PD risk. Furthermore, to validate the presence of these variants, we generated a subset of matched whole-genome long-read sequencing data. Results: We genotyped and tested 3,154 common SVs, representing over 412 million nucleotides of previously uncatalogued genetic variation. Using long-read sequencing data, we validated the presence of three novel deletion SVs that are associated with risk of PD from our initial association analysis, including a 2 kb intronic deletion within the gene LRRN4. Interpretation: We identified three SVs associated with genetic risk of PD. This study represents the most comprehensive assessment of the contribution of SVs to the genetic risk of PD to date.

Methods: We evaluated the association between autoimmune skin diseases (psoriasis or eczema) and air pollutant mixtures in 9060 subjects from the Personalized Environment and Genes Study (PEGS) cohort. Pollutant exposure data on six criteria air pollutants are publicly available from the Center for Air, Climate, and Energy Solutions and the Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group.

We applied logistic regression with quantile g-computation, adjusting for age, sex, diagnosis with an autoimmune disease in family or self, and smoking history to evaluate the relationship between self-reported diagnosis of an AI skin condition and air pollution mixtures.

Significance: While the etiology of autoimmune skin disorders is not clear, this study provides evidence that air pollutants are associated with an increased prevalence of these disorders. The results provide further evidence of potential health impacts of air pollution exposures on life-altering diseases. Significance and impact statement: The impact of air pollution on non-pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases is understudied and under-reported. We find that air pollution significantly increased the odds of psoriasis or eczema in our cohort and the magnitude is comparable to the risk associated with smoking exposure.

The frequencies of such oscillations are dynamically changing while clusters of weakly coupled mitochondrial oscillators adjust to a common phase and frequency. Across the cardiac myocyte, the averaged signal of the mitochondrial population follows self-similar or fractal dynamics; however, fractal properties of individual mitochondrial oscillators have not yet been examined. We show that the largest synchronously oscillating cluster exhibits a fractal dimension, D, that is indicative of self-similar behavior with D=1.27±0.11, in contrast to the remaining network mitochondria whose fractal dimension is close to that of Brownian noise, D=1.58±0.10.

However, there are few studies of the DunedinPACE measure among socioeconomically and racially diverse cohorts with longitudinal assessments. Objective: To investigate the association of race and poverty status with DunedinPACE scores in a socioeconomically diverse middle-aged cohort of African American and White participants. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal cohort study used data from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS) study. HANDLS is a population-based study of socioeconomically diverse African American and White adults aged 30 to 64 years at baseline in Baltimore, Maryland, with follow-up approximately every 5 years. The current study was restricted to 470 participants with blood samples at 2 time points: August 14, 2004, to June 22, 2009 (visit 1), and June 23, 2009, to September 12, 2017 (visit 2). Genome-wide DNAm was assessed at visit 1 (chronological age, 30-64 years) and visit 2. Data were analyzed from March 18, 2022, to February 9, 2023. Main Outcomes and Measures: DunedinPACE scores were estimated for each participant at 2 visits. DunedinPACE scores are values scaled to a mean of 1, interpretable with reference to a rate of 1 year of biological aging per 1 year of chronological aging. Linear mixed-model regression analysis was used to examine the trajectories of DunedinPACE scores by chronological age, race, sex, and poverty status. Results: Among 470 participants, the mean (SD) chronological age at visit 1 was 48.7 (8.7) years. Participants were balanced by sex (238 [50.6%] were men and 232 [49.4%] were women), race (237 [50.4%] African American and 233 [49.6%] White), and poverty status (236 [50.2%] living below poverty level and 234 [49.8%] living above poverty level). The mean (SD) time between visits was 5.1 (1.5) years. Overall, the mean (SD) DunedinPACE score was 1.07 (0.14), representing a 7% faster pace of biological aging than chronological aging. Linear mixed-effects regression analysis revealed an association between the 2-way interaction between race and poverty status (White race and household income below poverty level: β = 0.0665; 95% CI, 0.0298-0.1031; P <.001) and significantly higher DunedinPACE scores and an association between quadratic age (age squared: β = -0.0113; 95% CI, -0.0212 to -0.0013; P =.03) and significantly higher DunedinPACE scores.

This prospective cohort study assessed the associations of accelerometer-measured PA and SB with total CVD, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke (IS). METHODS AND RESULTS: The authors included 16 031 women aged 62 years and older, free of CVD, with adherent accelerometer wear (≥10 hours/day for ≥4 days) from the Women’s Health Study (mean age, 71.4 years [SD, 5.6 years]). Hip-worn ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers measured total volume of PA (total average daily vector magnitude), minutes per day of high-light PA and moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA), and SB. Women reported diagnoses of CVD, which were adjudicated using medical records and death certificates. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated for each exposure, and 95% CIs using Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for accelerometer wear time, age, self-reported general health, postmenopausal hormone therapy, smoking status, and alcohol use. The hypothetical effect of replacing 10 minutes/day of SB or high-light PA with MVPA on CVD incidence was assessed using adjusted isotemporal substitution Cox models. Over a mean of 7.1 years (SD, 1.6 years) of follow-up, 482 total CVD cases, 107 myocardial infarction cases, and 181 IS cases were diagnosed. Compared with the lowest quartiles of total average daily vector magnitude and MVPA (≤60 minutes), women who were in the highest quartiles (>120 minutes of MVPA) had a 43% (95% CI, 24%– 58%) and 38% (95% CI, 18%– 54%) lower hazard of total CVD, respectively. Estimates were similar for total average daily vector magnitude and MVPA with IS, but PA was not associated with myocardial infarction overall. High-light PA was not associated with any CVD outcomes. Women who spent <7.4 hours sedentary per day had a 33% (95% CI, 11%– 49%) lower hazard of total CVD compared with those who spent ≥9.5 hours sedentary. Replacing 10 minutes of SB with MVPA was associated with a 4% lower incidence of total CVD (HR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.93– 0.99]).

Design: A longitudinal observational study. Setting and Participants: Data from 1337 older adults age ≥65 years and free of physical frailty or cognitive impairment at baseline were obtained from the National Health Aging Trends Study (2011‒2017), a nationally representative cohort study of US older adult Medicare beneficiaries. Methods: Participants were assessed annually for frailty (physical frailty phenotype) and cognitive impairment (bottom quintile of clock drawing test or immediate and delayed recall; or proxy-report of diagnosis of dementia or AD8 score of ≥2). Incident falls were ascertained annually via self-report. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to estimate the association between order of first onset of cognitive impairment and/or frailty and incident single or repeated falls in the 1-year interval following their first onset. Results: Of the 1,337, 832 developed cognitive impairment first (termed “CI first”), 286 developed frailty first (termed “frailty first”) and 219 had co-occurrence of cognitive impairment and frailty within one year (termed “CI-frailty co-occurrence”) over 5 years. Overall, 491 (34.5%) had at least 1 fall during the 1-year interval following the onset of physical frailty and/or cognitive impairment. After adjustment, “CI-frailty co-occurrence” was associated with a more than 2-fold increased risk of repeated falls than “CI first” (odds ratio 2.35, 95% confidence interval 1.51‒3.67; P < .001). No significant difference was found between participants with “frailty first” and “CI first” (P = .07). In addition, the order of onset was not associated with risk of a single fall.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In 8,923 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study participants (aged 47–70 years, 57% women, 19% Black), we conducted discovery and internal validation for associations of 4,955 plasma proteins with incident diabetes. We externally validated results in the Singapore Multi-Ethnic Cohort (MEC) nested case-control (624 case subjects, 1,214 control subjects). We used Cox regression to discover and validate protein associations and risk-prediction models (elastic net regression with cardiometabolic risk factors and proteins) for incident diabetes. We conducted a pathway analysis and examined causality using genetic instruments. RESULTS There were 2,147 new diabetes cases over a median of 19 years. In the discovery sample (n = 6,010), 140 proteins were associated with incident diabetes after ad-justment for 11 risk factors (P < 10-5). Internal validation (n = 2,913) showed 64 of the 140 proteins remained significant (P < 0.05/140). Of the 63 available pro-teins, 47 (75%) were validated in MEC. Novel associations with diabetes were found for 22 the 47 proteins.

In the present study, we systematically investigated age-related behavioral changes in four specific domains of olfaction and the molecular basis in C57BL/6J mice. Our results showed that selective loss of odor discrimination was the earliest smelling behavioral change with aging, followed by a decline in odor sensitivity and detection while odor habituation remained in old mice. Compared to behavioral changes related with cognitive and motor functions, smelling loss was among the earliest biomarkers of aging. During aging, metabolites related with oxidative stress, osmolytes, and infection became dysregulated in the olfactory bulb, and G protein coupled receptor-related signaling was significantly down regulated in olfactory bulbs of aged mice.

In this regard, we postulate that hereditary disorders characterized by chromosomal instability offer a unique window of insight into aging and age-related disease processes. Recently, we discovered a new RECQ helicase disorder, designated RECON syndrome attributed to bi-allelic mutations in the RECQL1 gene (Abu-Libdeh et al., 2022).

Objective: We used results from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to study the genetic correlation between PD and different cancers to identify common genetic risk factors. Methods: We used individual data for participants of European ancestry from the Courage-PD (Comprehensive Unbiased Risk Factor Assessment for Genetics and Environment in Parkinson's Disease; PD, N = 16,519) and EPITHYR (differentiated thyroid cancer, N = 3527) consortia and summary statistics of GWASs from iPDGC (International Parkinson Disease Genomics Consortium; PD, N = 482,730), Melanoma Meta-Analysis Consortium (MMAC), Breast Cancer Association Consortium (breast cancer), the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome (prostate cancer), International Lung Cancer Consortium (lung cancer), and Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (ovarian cancer) (N comprised between 36,017 and 228,951 for cancer GWASs). We estimated the genetic correlation between PD and cancers using linkage disequilibrium score regression. We studied the association between PD and polymorphisms associated with cancers, and vice versa, using cross-phenotypes polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses. Results: We confirmed a previously reported positive genetic correlation of PD with melanoma (Gcorr = 0.16 [0.04; 0.28]) and reported an additional significant positive correlation of PD with prostate cancer (Gcorr = 0.11 [0.03; 0.19]). There was a significant inverse association between the PRS for ovarian cancer and PD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.89 [0.84; 0.94]). Conversely, the PRS of PD was positively associated with breast cancer (OR = 1.08 [1.06; 1.10]) and inversely associated with ovarian cancer (OR = 0.95 [0.91; 0.99]). The association between PD and ovarian cancer was mostly driven by rs183211 located in an intron of the NSF gene (17q21.31). Conclusions: We show evidence in favor of a contribution of pleiotropic genes to the association between PD and specific cancers. © 2023 The Authors.

Sixty-seven participants (mean age 65.0 years [±6.8], 16 [23.9%] women, 48 [71.6%] Black) were enrolled, including 15 with moderate to severe PAD (ankle brachial index [ABI] <0.60), 29 with mild PAD (ABI 0.60–0.90), and 23 without PAD (ABI 1.00–1.40).

The genes enhanced by TOP3B-TDRD3 are enriched with long and highly-expressed ones, which are also preferentially stimulated by other topoisomerases, suggesting that different topoisomerases may recognize their targets through a similar mechanism. Specifically, human HCT116 cells individually inactivated for TOP3B, TDRD3 or TOP3B topoisomerase activity, exhibit similarly disrupted transcription for both starvation-activated genes (SAGs) and starvation-repressed genes (SRGs). Responding to starvation, both TOP3B-TDRD3 and the elongating form of RNAPII exhibit concomitantly increased binding to TOP3B-dependent SAGs, at binding sites that overlap. Notably, TOP3B inactivation decreases the binding of elongating RNAPII to TOP3B-dependent SAGs while increased it to SRGs. Furthermore, TOP3B-ablated cells display reduced transcription of several autophagy-associated genes and autophagy per se.

The proposed method achieved comparable accuracy at a minimal time cost compared to manual reading. The proposed automated pipeline enables robust and time-efficient readings of ePVS from MR scans and demonstrates the importance of T2w MRI for ePVS detection and the potential benefits of using multimodal images.

We present evidence for functional cooperativity as a function of Nsp13 concentration, which suggests that oligomerization is important for optimal activity. In addition, under single-turnover conditions, Nsp13 unwound partial duplex RNA substrates of increasing double-stranded regions (16–30 base pairs) with similar efficiency, suggesting the enzyme unwinds processively in this range. We also show Nsp13-catalyzed RNA unwinding is abolished by a site-specific neutralizing linkage in the sugar–phosphate backbone, demonstrating continuity in the helicase-translocating strand is essential for unwinding the partial duplex substrate. Taken together, we demonstrate for the first time that coronavirus helicase Nsp13 disrupts a high-affinity RNA–protein interaction in a unidirectional and ATP-dependent manner. Furthermore, sensitivity of Nsp13 catalytic functions to Mg2+ concentration suggests a regulatory mechanism for ATP hydrolysis, duplex unwinding, and RNA protein remodeling, processes implicated in SARS-CoV-2 replication and proofreading.",19,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,coronavirus | COVID-19 | helicase | replication | SARS-CoV-2,102980,17592,NIH,undefined,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,304,00219258,NA,36739951

We found that the exon 6 skipping of DJ-1 induces mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired antioxidant capability. According to an in silico modeling study, the exon 6 skipping of DJ-1 disrupts the structural state suitable for the oxidation of the cysteine 106 residue that is a prerequisite for activating its neuroprotective roles.

Harmonisation across studies increases statistical power and allows meaningful comparisons between studies. We aimed to harmonise neuropathology measures across studies and assess the prevalence, correlation, and co-occurrence of neuropathologies in the ageing population. Methods: We combined data from six community-based autopsy cohorts in the US and the UK in a coordinated cross-sectional analysis. Among all decedents aged 80 years or older, we assessed 12 neuropathologies known to be associated with dementia: arteriolosclerosis, atherosclerosis, macroinfarcts, microinfarcts, lacunes, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage, Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease (CERAD) diffuse plaque score, CERAD neuritic plaque score, hippocampal sclerosis, limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC), and Lewy body pathology. We divided measures into three groups describing level of confidence (low, moderate, and high) in harmonisation. We described the prevalence, correlations, and co-occurrence of neuropathologies. Findings: The cohorts included 4354 decedents aged 80 years or older with autopsy data. All cohorts included more women than men, with the exception of one study that only included men, and all cohorts included decedents at older ages (range of mean age at death across cohorts 88·0–91·6 years). Measures of Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change, Braak stage and CERAD scores, were in the high confidence category, whereas measures of vascular neuropathologies were in the low (arterioloscerosis, atherosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and lacunes) or moderate (macroinfarcts and microinfarcts) categories. Neuropathology prevalence and co-occurrence was high (2443 [91%] of 2695 participants had more than one of six key neuropathologies and 1106 [41%] of 2695 had three or more). Co-occurrence was strongly but not deterministically associated with dementia status. Vascular and Alzheimer's disease features clustered separately in correlation analyses, and LATE-NC had moderate associations with Alzheimer's disease measures (eg, Braak stage ρ=0·31 [95% CI 0·20–0·42]). Interpretation: Higher variability and more inconsistency in the measurement of vascular neuropathologies compared with the measurement of Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change suggests the development of new frameworks for the measurement of vascular neuropathologies might be helpful. Results highlight the complexity and multi-morbidity of the brain pathologies that underlie dementia in older adults and suggest that prevention efforts and treatments should be multifaceted.

Objective: To investigate the regional associations of intensive vs standard BP control with small vessel disease biomarkers, such as white matter lesions (WMLs), fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and cerebral blood flow (CBF). Design, Setting, and Participants: The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) is a multicenter randomized clinical trial that compared intensive systolic BP (SBP) control (SBP target <120 mm Hg) vs standard control (SBP target <140 mm Hg) among participants aged 50 years or older with hypertension and without diabetes or a history of stroke. The study began randomization on November 8, 2010, and stopped July 1, 2016, with a follow-up duration of approximately 4 years. A total of 670 and 458 participants completed brain magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and follow-up, respectively, and comprise the cohort for this post hoc analysis. Statistical analyses for this post hoc analysis were performed between August 2020 and October 2022. Interventions: At baseline, 355 participants received intensive SBP treatment and 315 participants received standard SBP treatment. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were regional changes in WMLs, FA, MD (in white matter regions of interest), and CBF (in gray matter regions of interest). Results: At baseline, 355 participants (mean [SD] age, 67.7 [8.0] years; 200 men [56.3%]) received intensive BP treatment and 315 participants (mean [SD] age, 67.0 [8.4] years; 199 men [63.2%]) received standard BP treatment. Intensive treatment was associated with smaller mean increases in WML volume compared with standard treatment (644.5 mm3vs 1258.1 mm3). The smaller mean increases were observed specifically in the deep white matter regions of the left anterior corona radiata (intensive treatment, 30.3 mm3[95% CI, 16.0-44.5 mm3]; standard treatment, 80.5 mm3[95% CI, 53.8-107.2 mm3]), left tapetum (intensive treatment, 11.8 mm3[95% CI, 4.4-19.2 mm3]; standard treatment, 27.2 mm3[95% CI, 19.4-35.0 mm3]), left superior fronto-occipital fasciculus (intensive treatment, 3.2 mm3[95% CI, 0.7-5.8 mm3]; standard treatment, 9.4 mm3[95% CI, 5.5-13.4 mm3]), left posterior corona radiata (intensive treatment, 26.0 mm3[95% CI, 12.9-39.1 mm3]; standard treatment, 52.3 mm3[95% CI, 34.8-69.8 mm3]), left splenium of the corpus callosum (intensive treatment, 45.4 mm3[95% CI, 25.1-65.7 mm3]; standard treatment, 83.0 mm3[95% CI, 58.7-107.2 mm3]), left posterior thalamic radiation (intensive treatment, 53.0 mm3[95% CI, 29.8-76.2 mm3]; standard treatment, 106.9 mm3[95% CI, 73.4-140.3 mm3]), and right posterior thalamic radiation (intensive treatment, 49.5 mm3[95% CI, 24.3-74.7 mm3]; standard treatment, 102.6 mm3[95% CI, 71.0-134.2 mm3]). Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that intensive BP treatment, compared with standard treatment, was associated with a slower increase of WMLs, improved diffusion tensor imaging, and FA and CBF changes in several brain regions that represent vulnerable areas that may benefit from more strict BP control.

Methods: Participants were 435 cognitively normal adults in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging who completed wrist actigraphy at baseline (mean = 6.6 nights) and underwent longitudinal testing of memory, attention, executive function, language, and visuospatial ability. On average, participants with follow-up data were followed for 3.1 years. Primary predictors were baseline mean total sleep time, sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency (SE), and wake after sleep onset (WASO). Fully adjusted linear mixed-effects models included demographics, baseline health-related characteristics, smoking status, sleep medication use, APOE e4 carrier status, and interactions of each covariate with time. Results: In adjusted models, higher SE (per 10%; B = 0.11, p = .012) and lower WASO (per 30 minutes; B = -0.12, p = .007) were associated with better memory cross-sectionally. In contrast, higher SE was associated with greater visuospatial ability decline longitudinally (B = -0.02, p = .004). Greater WASO was associated with poorer visuospatial ability cross-sectionally (B = -0.09, p = .019) but slower declines in visuospatial abilities longitudinally (B = 0.02, p = .002). Several sleep-cognition cross-sectional and longitudinal associations were stronger in, or limited to, Black participants (compared to White participants). Conclusions: This study suggests cross-sectional sleep-cognition associations differ across distinct objective sleep parameters and cognitive domains. This study also provides preliminary evidence for racial differences across some sleep-cognition relationships.

Methods: Among cognitively normal participants in the BLSA and GESTALT studies who received MRI measures of myelin content (defined by myelin water fraction [MWF]) and axonal density (defined by neurite density index [NDI]), we quantified plasma levels of Aβ42, Aβ40, pTau181, NfL, and GFAP.

Effects of BZT on field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were established via electrophysiological recordings from slices collected from male C57BL/6J mice. The binding assays revealed that BZT binds to numerous receptors (e.g., σ2 Ki = 7 nM) and transporters (e.g., dopamine transporter Ki = 545 nM). Bath application of BZT potentiated hippocampal fEPSPs in mouse hippocampal slices with an EC50 of 2.03 nM. Following intraperitoneal administration, BZT was detected in the plasma, but not in the brain of mice. These data highlight that studies measuring peripheral endpoints or directly exposing systems, in vitro, intracerebroventricularly, or intracortically, to BZT-containing formulations should account for the direct effects of BZT. Our findings also suggest that earlier data attributing pharmacological effects to ketamine may be confounded by BZT and that additional investigation into the functional impact of BZT is warranted.",4,Journal,re,Review,100,8,8,Benzethonium | Electrophysiology | Excipient | Hippocampus | Ketamine | Synaptic transmission,109403,20435,NIH,ZIA-DA000069,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,317,00283908,NA,36565852

Design: Prospective observational study. Setting and Participants: Community-dwelling older subjects. Methods: We used data from the InChianti (N 897) and the SHARE (N 444) studies to derive and validate a scoring system consisting of FP components along with age, perceived health status and markers of socio-economic disadvantage. Backward stepwise logistic regressions were used to obtain a parsimonious model, able to predict the loss of ability to perform instrumental or basic activities of daily living over time. Results: A scoring system derived from a model only including age, low physical activity level, exhaustion and perceived health status had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.846 in the training cohort (InChianti), and 0.745 in the testing cohort (SHARE).

A color fundus (CF) photograph of the 30° central retina of each eye was obtained and graded according to the Age-Related Eye Disease Study system. Life-style choices were investigated using standardized questionnaires. The concentrations of several inflammatory biomarkers (i.e., complement component, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein) were measured. Polygenic risk score (PRS) was calculated and compared with results obtained from a European cohort. Results: A total of 756 subjects had gradable CF photographs for AMD detection. In 91.3%, no signs of AMD were observed. The prevalence rates of early and late AMDs were 6.9% and 0.6%, respectively. A total of 85% of subjects were physically active; only 13.5% were current smokers. Low concentrations of complement component, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein were found. We calculated the polygenic risk scores (PRS) using 40 AMD markers distributed on several candidate genes in Europeans and Sardinians. The mean PRS value was significantly lower in Sardinians than in the Europeans (0.21 vs. 0.248, respectively, p = 1.18 × 10−77).

Multidimensional MRI is an increasingly employed imaging modality that maximizes the amount of encoded chemical and microstructural information by probing relaxation (T1 and T2) and diffusion mechanisms simultaneously. Here, we harness the exquisite sensitivity of this imagining modality to derive a signature of astrogliosis and disentangle it from normative brain at the individual level using machine learning. We investigated ex vivo cerebral cortical tissue specimens derived from seven subjects who sustained blast-induced injuries, which resulted in scar-border forming astrogliosis without being accompanied by other types of neuropathological abnormality, and from seven control brain donors. By performing a combined post-mortem radiology and histopathology correlation study we found that astrogliosis induces microstructural and chemical changes that are robustly detected with multidimensional MRI, and which can be attributed to astrogliosis because no axonal damage, demyelination or tauopathy were histologically observed in any of the cases in the study. Importantly, we showed that no one-dimensional T1, T2 or diffusion MRI measurement can disentangle the microscopic alterations caused by this neuropathology. Based on these findings, we developed a within-subject anomaly detection procedure that generates MRI-based astrogliosis biomarker maps ex vivo, which were significantly and strongly correlated with co-registered histological images of increased glial fibrillary acidic protein deposition (r = 0.856, P < 0.0001; r = 0.789, P < 0.0001; r = 0.793, P < 0.0001, for diffusion-T2, diffusion-T1 and T1-T2 multidimensional data sets, respectively).

We aimed to examine longitudinal associations of olfaction with changes in brain volumes and neuropsychological function. Methods: In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, we chose the first assessment of olfaction to examine the associations with retrospective and prospective changes in neuropsychological performance and brain volumes in participants aged 50 years or older using linear mixed-effects models, adjusted for demographic variables and cardiovascular disease. Olfaction was measured as odor identification scores through the 16-item Sniffin' Sticks. Results: We analyzed data from 567 (58% women, 42% men, 27% Black, 66% White, and 7% others) participants who had data on odor identification scores and brain volumetric MRI (n = 420 with retrospective repeats over a mean of 3.7 years, n = 280 with prospective repeats over a mean of 1.2 years).

Higher odor identification scores were also associated with prior slower decline in memory, attention, processing speed, and manual dexterity and subsequent slower decline in attention (all p < 0.05). Some associations were attenuated after exclusion of data points at and after symptom onset of cognitive impairment or dementia. Discussion: In older adults, olfaction is related to brain atrophy of specific brain regions and neuropsychological changes in specific domains over time.

The MCULE-platform was used for screening a collection of 5 000 000 ligand molecules to evaluate their binding potential to the bacterial SHV-1 enzyme. Estimation of pharmacokinetic features was realized with the aid of the 'SWISS ADME' tool. Toxicity-checks were also performed. The docked complex of 'the top screened out ligand' and 'the bacterial SHV-1 protein' was subjected to molecular dynamics simulation of 101 ns. The obtained ligand molecule, 1,1'-(4H,8H-Bis[1,2,5]oxadiazolo[3,4-b:3′,4'-e]pyrazine-4,8-diyl)diethanone, displayed the most favourable binding interactions with bacterial SHV-1.

Noticeably, 12 of the 15 residues were found as common to the binding residues of the reference (PDB ID: 4ZAM). The RMSD values plotted against the simulation time showed that nearby 11 ns, equilibrium was reached and, thenceforth, the 'SHV-1-Top ligand' complex remained typically stable. Starting from around 11 ns and straight to 101 ns, the backbone RMSD fluctuations were found to be confined inside a range of 1.0-1.6 Å.

The 16S ribosomal RNA marker gene was sequenced from stool DNA, and genus-level taxonomy was assigned. Within-person microbial diversity (α-diversity) was assessed with Shannon diversity index and richness scores; between-person diversity (β-diversity) measures were generated with principal coordinates analysis (PCoA). Current and long-term physical activity and diet quality measures were derived from data collected over 30 y of follow-up. Multivariable-adjusted regression analysis controlled for: sociodemographic variables (age, race, sex, education, and field center), other health behaviors (smoking, alcohol consumption, and medication use), and adjusted for multiple comparisons with the false discovery rate (<0.20). Results: Based on PCoA β-diversity, participants’ microbial community compositions differed significantly (P < 0.001), with respect to both current and long-term physical activity and diet quality. α-Diversity was associated only with current physical activity (positively) in multivariable-adjusted analysis. Multiple genera (n = 45) were associated with physical activity and fewer with diet (n = 5), including positive associations with Lachnospiraceae UCG-001 and Ruminococcaceae Incertae Sedis with both behaviors.

Methods: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study Neurocognitive Study participants who underwent 3T brain MRI were included. Frailty status was classified according to the Fried criteria. Cerebral white matter integrity was defined using white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume and microstructure, measured using diffusion tensor imaging fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Multivariable linear regression was used to relate baseline frailty to white matter structure; multivariable logistic regression was used to relate baseline white matter to frailty risk among participants nonfrail at baseline. Results: In the cross-sectional analysis (N = 1 754; mean age: 76 years), frailty was associated with greater WMH volume, lower FA, and greater MD.

Despite the successful identification of multiple genetic variants associated with this highly heritable condition, its genetic architecture remains incompletely understood. More specifically, the role of DNA methylation has received little attention. We investigated the association between white matter hyperintensity burden and DNA methylation in blood at ∼450 000 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites in 9732 middle-aged to older adults from 14 community-based studies. Single CpG and region-based association analyses were carried out. Functional annotation and integrative cross-omics analyses were performed to identify novel genes underlying the relationship between DNA methylation and white matter hyperintensities. We identified 12 single CpG and 46 region-based DNA methylation associations with white matter hyperintensity burden. Our top discovery single CpG, cg24202936 (P = 7.6 × 10−8), was associated with F2 expression in blood (P = 6.4 × 10−5) and co-localized with FOLH1 expression in brain (posterior probability = 0.75).

Through Mendelian randomization analyses cg06809326 was putatively associated with white matter hyperintensity burden (P = 0.03) and expression of CCDC144NL-AS1 possibly mediated this association. Differentially methylated region analysis, joint epigenetic association analysis and multi-omics colocalization analysis consistently identified a role of DNA methylation near SH3PXD2A, a locus previously identified in genome-wide association studies of white matter hyperintensities. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed functions of the identified DNA methylation loci in the blood–brain barrier and in the immune response. Integrative cross-omics analysis identified 19 key regulatory genes in two networks related to extracellular matrix organization, and lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. A drug-repositioning analysis indicated antihyperlipidaemic agents, more specifically peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha, as possible target drugs for white matter hyperintensities. Our epigenome-wide association study and integrative cross-omics analyses implicate novel genes influencing white matter hyperintensity burden, which converged on pathways related to the immune response and to a compromised blood–brain barrier possibly due to disrupted cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix interactions.

Chronic exposure to SU lowered Cyb5r3 abundance and reduced islet glucose utilization in mice in vivo and in ex vivo murine islets. Cyb5r3 β cell–specific knockout mice phenocopied SU failure. Cyb5r3 engaged in a glucose-dependent interaction that stabilizes glucokinase (Gck) to maintain glucose utilization. Hence, Gck activators can circumvent Cyb5r3-dependent SU failure.

Lower cardiorespiratory fitness is a strong predictor of poor health outcomes, including all-cause mortality. Because V O 2max testing is resource intensive, several non-exercise-based V˙O2max prediction equations have been published. We assess these equations' ability to predict measured V˙O2max, recalibrate these equations, and quantify the association of measured and predicted V˙O2max with all-cause mortality. Methods Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants with valid V˙O2max tests were included (n = 1080). Using published V˙O2max prediction equations, we calculated predicted V˙O2max and present performance metrics before and after recalibration (deriving new regression estimates by regressing measured V˙O2max on Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging covariates). Cox proportional hazards models were fit to quantify associations of measured, predicted, and recalibration-predicted values of V˙O2max with mortality. Results Mean age and V˙O2max were 69.0 ± 10.4 yr and 21.6 ± 5.9 mL·kg-1·min-1, respectively. The prediction equations yielded root mean square error values ranging from 4.2 to 20.4 mL·kg-1·min-1.

We addressed this in a large multinational assembly of cohort studies that included information on lean mass, muscle strength, physical performance and health outcomes. Methods: White men from the Health Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study, Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study cohorts (Sweden, USA), the Hertfordshire Cohort Study (HCS) and the Sarcopenia and Physical impairment with advancing Age (SarcoPhAge) Study were analysed. Appendicular lean mass (ALM) was ascertained using DXA; muscle strength by grip dynamometry; and usual gait speed over courses of 2.4–6 m. Deaths were recorded and verified. Definitions of sarcopenia were as follows: EWGSOP2 (grip strength <27 kg and ALM index <7.0 kg/m2), SDOC (grip strength <35.5 kg and gait speed <0.8 m/s) and Modified SDOC (grip strength <35.5 kg and gait speed <1.0 m/s).

Methods: Participants were enrolled from Chicago, Illinois and consented to gastrocnemius biopsy. Mitochondrial oxidative capacity was measured in muscle with respirometry. Abundance of voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) (mitochondrial membrane abundance), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator (PGC-1α) (mitochondrial biogenesis), and electron transport chain complexes I–V were measured with Western blot. Results: Fourteen of 31 people with PAD (age 72.1 years, ABI 0.64) smoked cigarettes currently. Overall, there were no significant differences in mitochondrial oxidative capacity between PAD participants who currently smoked and those not currently smoking (complex I+II-mediated oxidative phosphorylation: 86.6 vs 78.3 pmolO2/s/mg, respectively [p = 0.39]). Among participants with PAD, those who currently smoked had a higher abundance of PGC-1α (p < 0.01), VDAC (p = 0.022), complex I (p = 0.021), and complex III (p = 0.021) proteins compared to those not currently smoking. People with PAD who currently smoked had lower oxidative capacity per VDAC unit (complex I+II-mediated oxidative phosphorylation [137.4 vs 231.8 arbitrary units, p = 0.030]) compared to people with PAD not currently smoking. Among people without PAD, there were no significant differences in any mitochondrial measures between currently smoking (n = 5) and those not currently smoking (n = 63). Conclusions: Among people with PAD, cigarette smoking may stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis to compensate for reduced oxidative capacity per unit of mitochondrial membrane, resulting in no difference in overall mitochondrial oxidative capacity according to current smoking status among people with PAD.

We examined associations of initial serum GDF15 concentrations with longitudinal cognitive performance, spanning domains of global mental status, visual and verbal memory, attention, fluency, and executive function in a sub-sample of adults participating in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study (n = 776, Agev1:30-66y, 45.6 % male, 57.0 % African American, 43.0 % below poverty). This analysis consisted of mixed-effects regression models applied to the total selected sample, while also stratifying the analyses by race in the main analyses and further stratifying by sex, age group and poverty status in an exploratory analysis.

Methods: Ten to 14 days after index hospitalization for ADHF, 93 participants wore a wrist-mounted triaxial accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X+) to objectively quantify sedentary behavior, light physical activity, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Levels were compared to 2 groups of age-matched NHANES participants: healthy and chronic, stable HF. The relationship between physical activity levels and physical function [Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)], HF-specific quality-of-life (QOL) [Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ)], and cognition [Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)] were examined. Results: ADHF participants accumulated a median 1,008 (IQR 896, 1,109) minutes of sedentary time, 88 (57, 139) minutes of light physical activity, and 10 (6, 25) minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day. Sedentary time, light physical activity, or moderate-to-vigorous activity did not differ by sex or EF subtype. ADHF participants spent only 9% of awake time nonsedentary, compared to 34% and 27% for healthy adults and adults with chronic, stable HF, respectively. Among ADHF participants, SPPB, KCCQ, and MOCA scores did not differ among quartiles of total physical activity. Conclusions: Older patients recently hospitalized for ADHF have very low levels of physical activity and high levels of sedentary time, both of which may be potential targets for interventions in this high-risk population. Physical activity level was not significantly associated with objectively measured physical function, QOL, or cognition, suggesting that this measure provides independent information regarding the patient experience of living with HF.

Methods: The study included individuals without dementia at baseline from the population-based AGES-Reykjavik Study. Depressive symptoms assessed with the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 and AL markers were collected at baseline. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was performed on the AL markers. Incident dementia was measured during 12-years of follow-up. Cox regressions adjusted for AL profiles were performed to evaluate if AL could explain the relation between depressive symptoms and incident dementia. Additional Cox regressions exploring the interaction with depressive symptoms and AL profiles were also performed. Results: LPA revealed four profiles based on AL factors: ‘Low cardiovascular dysregulation’ (43 %), ‘Average’ (42 % prevalence), ‘High cardiovascular dysregulation’ (11 %), and ‘Multisystem dysregulation’ (4 %). Cox regression analyses found an increased risk for dementia in the ‘Multisystem dysregulation’ group (HR 1.72; 95 % CI 1.26–2.33), as well as for AD (HR 1.75; 95 % CI: 1.12–2.71) and non-AD dementias (HR 1.87; 95 % CI: 1.23–2.84).

The AT1R promotes inflammation and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation. AT2R increases nitric oxide. AT4R is essential for dopamine and acetylcholine release. It is unknown whether ARB use is associated with changes in the brain RAS.

Age-associated cardiac inflammation is linked to structural and functional changes in the heart, including mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired proteostasis, hypertrophic cardiac remodeling, and contractile dysfunction. Can ARA290 ameliorate these age-associated cardiac changes and the severity of frailty in advanced age? Methods: We conducted an integrated longitudinal (n = 48) and cross-sectional (n = 144) 15 months randomized controlled trial in which 18-month-old Fischer 344 x Brown Norway rats were randomly assigned to either receive chronic ARA290 treatment or saline. Serial echocardiography, tail blood pressure and body weight were evaluated repeatedly at 4-month intervals. A frailty index was calculated at the final timepoint (33 months of age). Tissues were harvested at 4-month intervals to define inflammatory markers and left ventricular tissue remodeling. Mitochondrial and myocardial cell health was assessed in isolated left ventricular myocytes. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were established. Mixed ANOVA tests and linear mixed regression analysis were employed to determine the effects of age, treatment, and age-treatment interactions. Results: Chronic ARA290 treatment mitigated age-related increases in the cardiac non-myocyte to myocyte ratio, infiltrating leukocytes and monocytes, pro-inflammatory cytokines, total NF-κB, and p-NF-κB.

To investigate the association of PWV with genetic variants, lipid, and inflammation biomarkers, we employed linear mixed modeling, using age as the time scale.

These secreted molecules bind to membrane receptors, which then activate signal transduction pathways to mediate various endocrine/trophic functions. Recently, there is evidence that these molecules are also in extracellular vesicles, including small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), which appear to be taken up by recipient cells. This finding raised the hypothesis that they may have functions differentiated from their classical secretory hormone/neurotrophic factor actions. In this article, the historical perspective and updated mechanisms for the sorting and packaging of hormones and neurotrophic factors into secretory vesicles and their transport in these organelles for release at the plasma membrane are reviewed. In contrast, little is known about the packaging of hormones and neurotrophic factors into extracellular vesicles. One proposal is that these molecules could be sorted at the trans-Golgi network, which then buds to form Golgi-derived vesicles that can fuse to endosomes and subsequently form intraluminal vesicles. They are then taken up by multivesicular bodies to form extracellular vesicles, which are subsequently released. Other possible mechanisms for packaging RSP proteins into sEVs are discussed.

Here, we developed and tested a new conceptual numerical model of SAN organized similarly to brain networks featuring a modular structure with small-world topology.

Since experimental studies found functional modules at different scales, from a few cells up to the highest scale of the superior and inferior SAN, the SAN appears to feature hierarchical modularity, i.e., within each module, there is a set of sub-modules, like in the brain, exhibiting greater robustness, adaptivity, and evolvability of network function.

Despite the availability of medications for opioid use disorders, provider-level barriers, such as negative attitudes, exacerbate the treatment gap in clinical care settings. Assessing the prevalence and intensity of provider stigma, defined as the negative perceptions and behaviors that providers embody and enact toward patients with substance use disorders, across providers with different specialties, is critical to expanding the delivery of substance use treatment. Objective: To thoroughly understand provider stigma toward patients with substance use disorders, we conducted a nationwide survey of emergency medicine and primary care physicians and dentists using a questionnaire designed to reveal how widely and intensely provider attitudes and stigma can impact these providers’ clinical practices in caring for their patients. The survey also queried providers’ stigma and clinical practices toward other chronic conditions, which can then be compared with their stigma and practices related to substance use disorders. Methods: Our cross-sectional survey was mailed to a nationally representative sample of primary care physicians, emergency medicine physicians, and dentists (N=3011), obtained by American Medical Association and American Dental Association licensees based on specified selection criteria. We oversampled nonmetropolitan practice areas, given the potential differences in provider stigma and available resources in these regions compared with metropolitan areas. Data collection followed a recommended series of contacts with participants per the Dillman Total Design Method, with mixed-modality options offered (email, mail, fax, and phone). A gradually increasing compensation scale (maximum US$250) was implemented to recruit chronic nonresponders and assess the association between requiring higher incentives to participate and providers stigma. The primary outcome, provider stigma, was measured using the Medical Condition Regard Scale, which inquired about participants’ views on substance use and other chronic conditions. Additional survey measures included familiarity and social engagement with people with substance use disorders; clinical practices (screening, treating, and referring for a range of chronic conditions); subjective norms and social desirability; knowledge and prior education; and descriptions of their patient populations.

This new imaging method simultaneously encodes the microstructure, the local chemical composition and importantly their correlation within complex and heterogenous tissue. To validate our approach, we compared the intra-cortical layers obtained using our ex vivo MRI-based method with those derived from Nissl staining of postmortem human brain specimens. The integration of unsupervised learning with diffusion–relaxation correlation MRI generated maps that demonstrate sensitivity to areal differences in cytoarchitectonic features observed in histology. Significantly, our observations revealed layer-specific diffusion–relaxation signatures, showing reductions in both relaxation times and diffusivities at the deeper cortical levels. These findings suggest a radial decrease in myelin content and changes in cell size and anisotropy, reflecting variations in both cytoarchitecture and myeloarchitecture. Additionally, we demonstrated that 1D relaxation and high-order diffusion MRI scalar indices, even when aggregated and used jointly in a multimodal fashion, cannot disentangle the cortical layers.

Methods: A two-stage genome-wide meta-analysis of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and triglyceride (TG) levels was performed while accounting for gene-educational attainment interactions in up to 226,315 individuals from five population groups. We considered two educational attainment variables: “Some College” (yes/no, for any education beyond high school) and “Graduated College” (yes/no, for completing a 4-year college degree). Genome-wide significant (p < 5 × 10−8) and suggestive (p < 1 × 10−6) variants were identified in Stage 1 (in up to 108,784 individuals) through genome-wide analysis, and those variants were followed up in Stage 2 studies (in up to 117,531 individuals). Results: In combined analysis of Stages 1 and 2, we identified 18 novel lipid loci (nine for LDL, seven for HDL, and two for TG) by two degree-of-freedom (2 DF) joint tests of main and interaction effects. Four loci showed significant interaction with educational attainment. Two loci were significant only in cross-population analyses. Several loci include genes with known or suggested roles in adipose (FOXP1, MBOAT4, SKP2, STIM1, STX4), brain (BRI3, FILIP1, FOXP1, LINC00290, LMTK2, MBOAT4, MYO6, SENP6, SRGAP3, STIM1, TMEM167A, TMEM30A), and liver (BRI3, FOXP1) biology, highlighting the potential importance of brain-adipose-liver communication in the regulation of lipid metabolism. An investigation of the potential druggability of genes in identified loci resulted in five gene targets shown to interact with drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration, including genes with roles in adipose and brain tissue.

Although its identification remains the primary diagnostic criteria to distinguish chronic traumatic encephalopathy from other tauopathies, the hyperphosphorylated tau that accumulates in neurofibrillary tangles in cortical grey matter and perivascular regions is often accompanied by concomitant pathology such as astrogliosis. Mean apparent propagator MRI is a clinically feasible diffusion MRI method that is suitable to characterize microstructure of complex biological media efficiently and comprehensively. We performed quantitative correlations between propagator metrics and underlying phosphorylated tau and astroglial pathology in a cross-sectional study of 10 ex vivo human tissue specimens with 'high chronic traumatic encephalopathy' at 0.25 mm isotropic voxels. Linear mixed effects analysis of regions of interest showed significant relationships of phosphorylated tau with propagator-estimated non-Gaussianity in cortical grey matter (P = 0.002) and of astrogliosis with propagator anisotropy in superficial cortical white matter (P = 0.0009). The positive correlation between phosphorylated tau and non-Gaussianity was found to be modest but significant (R2 = 0.44, P = 6.0 × 10-5) using linear regression. We developed an unsupervised clustering algorithm with non-Gaussianity and propagator anisotropy as inputs, which was able to identify voxels in superficial cortical white matter that corresponded to astrocytes that were accumulated at the grey-white matter interface.

Studies suggest that increasing dietary omega-3 fatty acid is associated with headache reduction, but less is known about the effects on quality of life in migraine. Methods: After a 4-week run-in, 182 adults with 5–20 migraine days per month were randomized to one of the 3 arms for sixteen weeks. Dietary arms included: H3L6 (a high omega-3, low omega-6 diet), H3 (a high omega-3, an average omega-6 diet), or a control diet (average intakes of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids). Prespecified secondary endpoints included daily diary measures (stress perception, sleep quality, and perceived health), Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Version 1.0 ([PROMIS©) measures and the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS). Analyses used linear mixed effects models to control for repeated measures. Results: The H3L6 diet was associated with significant improvements in stress perception [adjusted mean difference (aMD): −1.5 (95% confidence interval: −1.7 to −1.2)], sleep quality [aMD: 0.2 (95% CI:0.1–0.2)], and perceived health [aMD: 0.2 (0.2–0.3)] compared to the control. Similarly, the H3 diet was associated with significant improvements in stress perception [aMD: −0.8 (−1.1 to −0.5)], sleep quality [aMD: 0.2 (0.1, 0.3)], and perceived health [aMD: 0.3 (0.2, 0.3)] compared to the control. MIDAS scores improved substantially in the intervention groups compared with the control (H3L6 aMD: −11.8 [−25.1, 1.5] and H3 aMD: −10.7 [−24.0, 2.7]). Among the PROMIS-29 assessments, the biggest impact was on pain interference [H3L6 MD: −1.8 (−4.4, 0.7) and H3 aMD: −3.2 (−5.9, −0.5)] and pain intensity [H3L6 MD: −0.6 (−1.3, 0.1) and H3 aMD: −0.6 (−1.4, 0.1)]. Discussion: The diary measures, with their increased power, supported our hypothesis that symptoms associated with migraine attacks could be responsive to specific dietary fatty acid manipulations. Changes in the PROMIS© measures reflected improvements in non-headache pain as well as physical and psychological function, largely in the expected directions. These findings suggest that increasing omega-3 with or without decreasing omega-6 in the diet may represent a reasonable adjunctive approach to reducing symptoms associated with migraine attacks.

Methods: We assessed the interplay of emotional regulation and autobiographical memory by inviting 18 bvFTD and 20 control participants to remember past personal events. For each memory, participants rated its emotional valence “then” (i.e. when the event has occurred) vs “now” (i.e. when retrieving the event). Results: Patients with bvFTD described their memories as neutral at both times (p =.85), while control participants rated their memories as more positive during “then” than during “now” (p =.013). Autobiographical retrieval triggered fewer emotional words (p <.001) and less specificity (p <.001) in bvFTD patients compared to control participants. Conclusions: The lack of significant differences between the emotional characteristics during “then” than “now” in patients with bvFTD (and the flattening of both) may mirror their hampered ability for emotional generation, which may be associated with difficulties in reframing their past experiences to modify and adapt their meaning.

The soluble phase of plasma and plasma neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) are increasingly being investigated as sources of biomarkers. The aim of this study was to examine the comparative biomarker potential of these two biofluids, as well as the association between respective biomarkers. Methods: We retrospectively identified three distinct diagnostic groups of 44 individuals who provided samples at baseline and at a mean of 3.1 years later; 14 were cognitively unimpaired at baseline and remained so (NRM-NRM), 13 had amnestic MCI that progressed to AD dementia (MCI-DEM) and 17 had AD dementia at both timepoints (DEM-DEM). Plasma NDEVs were isolated by immunoaffinity capture targeting the neuronal markers L1CAM, GAP43, and NLGN3. In both plasma and NDEVs, we assessed ATN biomarkers (Aβ42, Aβ40, total Tau, P181-Tau) alongside several other exploratory markers. Results: The Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in plasma and NDEVs was lower in MCI-DEM than NRM-NRM at baseline and its levels in NDEVs decreased over time in all three groups. Similarly, plasma and NDEV-associated Aβ42 was lower in MCI-DEM compared to NRM-NRM at baseline and its levels in plasma decreased over time in DEM-DEM. For NDEV-associated proBDNF, compared to NRM-NRM, its levels were lower in MCI-DEM and DEM-DEM at baseline, and they decreased over time in the latter group. No group differences were found for other exploratory markers. NDEV-associated Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and proBDNF achieved the highest areas under the curve (AUCs) for discriminating between diagnostic groups, while proBDNF was positively associated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. No associations were found between the two biofluids for any assessed marker. Discussion: The soluble phase of plasma and plasma NDEVs demonstrate distinct biomarker profiles both at a single time point and longitudinally. The lack of association between plasma and NDEV measures indicates that the two types of biofluids demonstrate distinct biomarker signatures that may be attributable to being derived through different biological processes.

However, NODDI overestimates the cerebrospinal fluid water fraction in white matter (WM) and provides physiologically unrealistic high NDI values. Furthermore, derived NDI values are echo-time (TE)-dependent. In this work, we propose a modification of NODDI, named constrained NODDI (C-NODDI), for NDI and ODI mapping in WM. Methods: Using NODDI and C-NODDI, we investigated age-related alterations in WM in a cohort of 58 cognitively unimpaired adults. Further, NDI values derived using NODDI or C-NODDI were correlated with the neurofilament light chain (NfL) concentration levels, a plasma biomarker of axonal degeneration. Finally, we investigated the TE dependence of NODDI or C-NODDI derived NDI and ODI. Results: ODI derived values using both approaches were virtually identical, exhibiting constant trends with age. Further, our results indicated a quadratic relationship between NDI and age suggesting that axonal maturation continues until middle age followed by a decrease. This quadratic association was notably significant in several WM regions using C-NODDI, while limited to a few regions using NODDI. Further, C-NODDI-NDI values exhibited a stronger correlation with NfL concentration levels as compared to NODDI-NDI, with lower NDI values corresponding to higher levels of NfL.

Here, we used a large-scale proteomics platform to examine the association of 4877 plasma proteins with 25-year dementia risk in 10,981 middle-aged adults. We found 32 dementia-associated plasma proteins that were involved in proteostasis, immunity, synaptic function, and extracellular matrix organization. We then replicated the association between 15 of these proteins and clinically relevant neurocognitive outcomes in two independent cohorts. We demonstrated that 12 of these 32 dementia-associated proteins were associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD, neurodegeneration, or neuroinflammation. We found that eight of these candidate protein markers were abnormally expressed in human postmortem brain tissue from patients with AD, although some of the proteins that were most strongly associated with dementia risk, such as GDF15, were not detected in these brain tissue samples. Using network analyses, we found a protein signature for dementia risk that was characterized by dysregulation of specific immune and proteostasis/autophagy pathways in adults in midlife ~20 years before dementia onset, as well as abnormal coagulation and complement signaling ~10 years before dementia onset.

Therefore, higher thyroid hormone levels could be a factor in the development of sarcopenia and age associated functional decline. The relationship between thyroid hormone and muscle mass in ambulatory, euthyroid older adults is not known. Method: We used mixed-effects models to estimate the cross-sectional relationships (accounting for inter-person variability) between thyroid axis hormone measures and lower limb composition or sarcopenia at visits in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) at which DEXA scans were available and both thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) were in the reference range.

We aimed to develop and optimize an alternative, highly specific immunoaffinity method to enrich blood NDEVs for biomarker development. Methods: After screening multiple neuronal antigens, we achieved NDEV capture with high affinity and specificity using antibodies against Growth-Associated Protein (GAP) 43 and Neuroligin 3 (NLGN3). The EV identity of the captured material was confirmed by electron microscopy, western blotting, and proteomics. The specificity for neuronal origin was demonstrated by showing enrichment for neuronal markers (proteins, mRNA) and recovery of spiked neuronal EVs.

Second, we characterized the dynamic changes in the transcriptomes of cells as they developed etoposide-induced senescence; by tracking cell transitions across this process, we found two different senescence programs that developed divergently, one in which cells expressed traditional senescence markers such as p16 (CDKN2A) mRNA, and another in which cells expressed long noncoding RNAs and splicing was dysregulated. Finally, we obtained evidence that the proliferation status at the time of senescence initiation affected the path of senescence, as determined based on the expressed RNAs. We propose that a deeper understanding of the transcriptomes during the progression of different senescent cell phenotypes will help develop more effective interventions directed at this detrimental cell population",23,Journal,ar,Article,100,10,10,senescence | single-cell analysis | transcriptome,NA,71628,NIH,undefined,National Institutes of Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,396,19454589,2824-2851,37086265

Apoptosis plays an essential part in the pathophysiology of TBI, and its inhibition may help overcome TBI's negative consequences and improve functional recovery. Although physiological neuronal death is necessary for appropriate embryologic development and adult cell turnover, it can also drive neurodegeneration. Caspases are principal mediators of cell death due to apoptosis and are critical for the required cleavage of intracellular proteins of cells committed to die. Caspase-3 is the major executioner Caspase of apoptosis and is regulated by a range of cellular components during physiological and pathological conditions. Activation of Caspase-3 causes proteolyzation of DNA repair proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, and the inhibitor of Caspase-activated DNase (ICAD) during programmed cell death, resulting in morphological alterations and DNA damage that define apoptosis. Caspase-9 is an additional crucial part of the intrinsic pathway, activated in response to several stimuli. Caspases can be altered post-translationally or by modulatory elements interacting with the zymogenic or active form of a Caspase, preventing their activation. The necessity of Caspase-9 and-3 in diverse apoptotic situations suggests that mammalian cells have at least four distinct apoptotic pathways.

Although the aetiology of autism remains unclear, disturbance of neuron-glia interactions has lately been proposed as a significant event in the pathophysiology of ASD. In recent years, the contribution of glial cells to autism has been overlooked. In addition to neurons, glial cells play an essential role in mental activities, and a new strategy that emphasises neuron-glia interactions should be applied. Disturbance of neuron-glia connections has lately been proposed as a significant event in the pathophysiology of ASD because aberrant neuronal network formation and dysfunc-tional neurotransmission are fundamental to the pathology of the condition. In ASD, neuron and glial cell number changes cause brain circuits to malfunction and impact behaviour. A study revealed that reactive glial cells result in the loss of synaptic functioning and induce autism under inflammatory conditions. Recent discoveries also suggest that dysfunction or changes in the ability of microglia to carry out physiological and defensive functions (such as failure in synaptic elimination or aberrant mi-croglial activation) may be crucial for developing brain diseases, especially autism. The cerebellum, white matter, and cortical regions of autistic patients showed significant microglial activation. Reactive glial cells result in the loss of synaptic functioning and induce autism under inflammatory condi-tions. Replacement of defective glial cells (Cell-replacement treatment), glial progenitor cell-based therapy, and medication therapy (inhibition of microglia activation) are all utilised to treat glial dys-function.

To do this, we used three large, longitudinal and cross-sectional datasets (N = 1293 subjects, 2711 sessions) to quantify microstructural features and length/volume features of several SWM systems. We find that axial, radial, and mean diffusivities show positive associations with age, while fractional anisotropy has negative associations with age in SWM throughout the entire brain. These associations were most pronounced in the frontal, temporal, and temporoparietal regions. Moreover, measures of SWM volume and length decrease with age in a heterogenous manner across the brain, with different rates of change in inter-gyri and intra-gyri SWM, and at slower rates than well-studied long-range white matter pathways.

Currently, we recognize LRRK2 p.G2019S as the most common genetic cause of both sporadic and familial PD, with more than 100,000 affected carriers across the globe. The frequency of LRRK2 p.G2019S is also highly variable across populations, with some regions of Asian or Latin America reporting close to 0%, contrasting to Ashkenazi Jews or North African Berbers reporting up to 13% and 40%, respectively.

Indeed, the majority of patients with LRRK2-related disease are characterized by a relatively mild Parkinsonism with less motor symptoms with variable presence of α-synuclein and/or tau aggregates, with pathologic pleomorphism widely described. At a functional cellular level, it is likely that pathogenic variants mediate a toxic gain-of-function of the LRRK2 protein resulting in increased kinase activity perhaps in a cell-specific manner; by contrast, some LRRK2 variants appear to be protective reducing PD risk by decreasing the kinase activity.

By virtue of the stress information conferred by protofibrillar APs, the OLs in offspring’s brain might be more resilient to forthcoming stressors, perhaps reducing MS risk. aEVO could be comparable to a gene for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. On the contrary, during ageing, MSA risk is increased through antagonistic pleiotropy. Consistently, the expression levels of APs are reduced in MS, but are increased in MSA compared to controls.

Design: Pooled analysis. Data sources: A consortium of 19 studies from 12 countries identified up to May 2020. Study selection: Prospective studies with measured n-3 PUFA biomarker data and incident CKD based on estimated glomerular filtration rate. Data extraction and synthesis: Each participating cohort conducted de novo analysis with prespecified and consistent exposures, outcomes, covariates, and models. The results were pooled across cohorts using inverse variance weighted meta-analysis. Main outcome measures: Primary outcome of incident CKD was defined as new onset estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. In a sensitivity analysis, incident CKD was defined as new onset estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and <75% of baseline rate. Results: 25 570 participants were included in the primary outcome analysis and 4944 (19.3%) developed incident CKD during follow-up (weighted median 11.3 years).

Using gene knockdown and overexpression approaches, the present study examined whether DDR2 is a target of metformin and whether, by targeting DDR2, it inhibits Fibronectin and Collagen type I expression in rat aortic adventitial fibroblasts exposed to hyperglycaemic conditions. Metformin was found to attenuate hyperglycaemia-induced increase in DDR2 mRNA and protein expression by inhibiting TGF-β1/SMAD2/3 signalling that mediates the stimulatory effect of hyperglycaemia on DDR2 expression. Metformin also inhibited DDR2-dependent expression of Fibronectin and Collagen type I, indicating that it regulates these matrix proteins via DDR2 inhibition.

DNA repetitive elements account for >50% of the human genome; however, little is known of their contribution to Parkinson’s disease aetiology. While select short tandem repeats (STRs) within candidate genes have been studied in Parkinson’s disease, their genome-wide contribution remains unknown. Here we present the first genome-wide association study of STRs in Parkinson’s disease. Through a meta-analysis of 16 imputed genome-wide association study cohorts from the International Parkinson’s Disease Genomic Consortium (IPDGC), totalling 39 087 individuals (16 642 cases and 22 445 controls of European ancestry), we identified 34 genome-wide significant STR loci (P< 5.34 × 10−6), with the strongest signal located in KANSL1 [chr17:44 205 351:[T]11, P= 3 × 10−39, odds ratio = 1.31 (95% confidence interval = 1.26–1.36)]. Conditional-joint analyses suggested that four significant STRs mapping nearby NDUFAF2, TRIML2, MIRNA-129–1 and NCOR1 were independent from known risk SNPs. Including STRs in heritability estimates increased the variance explained by SNPs alone. Gene expression analysis of STRs (eSTRs) in RNA sequencing data from 13 brain regions identified significant associations of STRs influencing the expression of multiple genes, including known Parkinson’s disease genes. Further functional annotation of candidate STRs revealed that significant eSTRs within NUDFAF2 and ZSWIM7 overlap with regulatory features and are associated with change in the expression levels of nearby genes. Here, we show that STRs at known and novel candidate loci contribute to Parkinson’s disease risk and have functional effects in disease-relevant tissues and pathways, supporting previously reported disease-associated genes and giving further evidence for their functional prioritization.

Premature genetic reduction of Lamin C phenocopies aging’s effects on the nucleus and subsequently decreases heart contractility and sarcomere organization. Notably, Lamin C reduction downregulates myogenic transcription factors and cytoskeletal regulators, possibly via reduced chromatin accessibility.

Though these techniques are prone to have variability, they can be robust tools for quantifying DNA damage when planned and executed carefully. Here, we present both assays and highlight each technique’s advantages and challenges in measuring DNA damage in cells with limiting cell number, such as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The Comet assay is highly sensitive at the cost of increased variability. The Halo assay attenuates some of the effects of variability present in the Comet assay but does not eliminate them entirely and is less sensitive. Overall, the Comet and Halo assays are powerful means of directly measuring DNA damage.

Occurrence of drug resistance attributable to CXTM-variants in bacterial pathogens is widespread. In line with our above proposed thumb rule, the present article employed concatenation of virtual screening, docking and simulation to identify a potent in silico validated anti-CTXM-14 ligand. Specifically, this research used the ‘MCULE’ drug discovery platform to screen a total of 5 million candidate inhibitors to evaluate their binding efficacy with an antibiotic resistance enzyme, CTXM-14 found in bacterial pathogens. A new median approach between ‘structure’ and ‘ligand’-based protocols was employed. Pharmacokinetic profiling was achieved by ‘SWISS ADME’. Safety profile for humans was appraised by ‘Toxicity Checker’. The complex consisting of the ‘Top ligand’ (obtained from the screen) harbored within the active pocket of the bacterial CTXM-14 was subjected to 60 ns molecular dynamics simulation with the aid of licensed YASARA STRUCTURE v.21.8.27. Complex tasks were performed by YANACONDA. Fine resolution figures (notably, plots generated from trajectory analyses) were constructed. Simulation snaps were acquired at every 250 picoseconds of the run. The ligand having the IUPAC name as 1-Amino-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pyrido[1,2-a]benzimidazole-2,4-dicarbonitrile demonstrated the overall best binding with CTXM-14. Fifteen amino acid residues were found to line the interacting pocket. Remarkably, all of these interacting residues were found to be present among the interacting residues displayed by the reference complex as well, i.e. CTXM-14:Vaborbactam complex (PDB ID 6V7H). A total of 240 simulation snaps were retrieved. The RMSD plot revealed that a plateau was achieved at 32 ns, after which the backbone RMSD fluctuations remained confined within 1.4-2 Å. Video recording of molecular actions was also achieved. In conclusion, this study provides a fresh lead molecule, 1-Amino-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pyrido[1,2-a]benzimidazole-2,4-dicarbonitrile against bacterial CTXM-14 protein. The study utilized a new median approach between ‘structure’ and ‘ligand’-based drug design. The lead molecule passed ADMET conditions and an array of medicinal chemistry filters, and is further supported by a stable molecular dynamics. An acceptable skin permeation supports its probable use in antibiotic creams. Moreover, the study provides a clear ‘Thumb Rule for Antibiotic Design’ against bacteria, which although often assumed, can be clearly stated for the first time. Synthesis of the screening-proposed molecule followed by in-vitro and in-vivo validation is highly recommended. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Strategy and Key Results: Mild AD patient received a single infusion of low- or high-dose Lomecel-B, or placebo, in a double-blind, randomized, phase I trial. The primary safety endpoint was met. Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers indicated significant improvement in the Lomecel-B arms versus placebo. The low-dose Lomecel-B arm showed significant improvements versus placebo on neurocognitive and other assessments.

Previously we found that long-term resveratrol administration (up to 480 mg/day) ameliorates the slow-to-fast phenotypic shift in soleus muscles and promotes the expression in slow myosin heavy chain in the mixed plantaris muscle of non-human primates consuming a high fat/sugar (HFS) diet. Here, we expand on these earlier findings by examining whether mitochondrial content and the markers that dictate their biogenesis and mitophagy/autophagy are similarly affected by HFS and/or influenced by resveratrol while consuming this diet (HFSR). Compared to controls (n = 9), there was a ∼20–25% decrease in mitochondrial content in HFS (n = 8) muscles as reflected in the COX2- and CYTB-to-GAPDH ratios using PCR analysis, which was blunted by resveratrol in HFSR (n = 7) soleus and, to a lesser degree, in plantaris muscles. A ∼1.5 and 3-fold increase in Rev-erb-α protein was detected in HFSR soleus and plantaris muscles compared to controls, respectively. Unlike in HFSR animals, HFS soleus and plantaris muscles exhibited a ∼2-fold elevation in phosphor-AMPKα (Thr172). HFS soleus muscles had elevated phosphorylated-to-total TANK binding protein-1 (TBK1) ratio suggesting an enhancement in mito/autophagic events. Taken together, resveratrol appears to blunt mitochondrial losses with a high fat/sugar diet by tempering mito/autophagy rather than promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, suggesting that the quantity of daily resveratrol supplement ingested and/or its long-term consumption are important considerations.

Behavioral tests including locomotor and wheel running activity, rotarod performance test, and alcohol preference tests were used to evaluate behavioral changes induced by alcohol. Using ELISA assay, we investigated the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1α (IL-1α), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in the hippocampus of mice. The findings demonstrated that locomotor activity, wheel running, and rotarod performance activities were significantly affected by cell-type specific deletion of CB2Rs in dopamine neurons and microglia. The non-selective CB2R agonist, WIN 55,212-2, reduced alcohol preference in the wild type and cell-type specific CB2R cKO mice. In addition, the result showed that cell-type specific deletion of CB2Rs per se and administration of alcohol to CB2R cKO mice increased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus.
