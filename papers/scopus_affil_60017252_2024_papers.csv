The recent revision of the Alzheimer's Association (AA) criteria for AD furthers this direction. However, concerns about a purely biological definition of AD being applied clinically, the understanding of AD by society at large, and the translation of blood-based biomarkers into clinical practice prompt these International Working Group (IWG) updated recommendations. Objective: To consider the revised AA criteria and to offer an alternative definitional view of AD as a clinical-biological construct for clinical use. The recommendations of the 2021 IWG diagnostic criteria are updated for further elaborating at-risk and presymptomatic states. Evidence Review: PubMed was searched for articles published between July 1, 2020, and March 1, 2024, using the terms ""biomarker""OR ""amyloid""OR ""tau""OR ""neurodegeneration""OR ""preclinical""OR ""CSF""OR ""PET""OR ""plasma""AND ""Alzheimer's disease.""The references of relevant articles were also searched. Findings: In the new AA diagnostic criteria, AD can be defined clinically as encompassing cognitively normal people having a core 1 AD biomarker. However, recent literature shows that the majority of biomarker-positive cognitively normal individuals will not become symptomatic along a proximate timeline. In the clinical setting, disclosing a diagnosis of AD to cognitively normal people with only core 1 AD biomarkers represents the most problematic implication of a purely biological definition of the disease. Conclusions and Relevance: The ultimate aim of the field was to foster effective AD treatments, including preventing symptoms and dementia. The approach of diagnosing AD without a clinical and biological construct would be unwarranted and potentially concerning without a clear knowledge of when or whether symptoms will ever develop. It is recommended that those who are amyloid-positive only and, more generally, most biomarker-positive cognitively normal individuals, should not be labeled as having AD. Rather, they should be considered as being at risk for AD. The expansion of presymptomatic AD is viewed as a better diagnostic construct for those with a specific pattern of biomarkers, indicating that they are proximate to the expression of symptoms in the near future.",38,39483064,Journal,re,Review,100,45,45,21100228519,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While large research consortia are performing widespread research genetic testing to accelerate discoveries, debate continues about whether, and to what extent, the results should be returned to patients. Ethically, it is imperative to keep participants informed, especially when findings are potentially actionable. However, research testing may not hold the same standards required from clinical diagnostic laboratories and hold significant psychosocial implications. The absence of universally recognized protocols complicates the establishment of appropriate guidelines.MethodsAiming to develop recommendations on return of research results (RoR) practice within the Global Parkinson's Genetics Program (GP2), we conducted a global survey to gain insight on GP2 members' perceptions, practice, readiness, and needs surrounding RoR.ResultsGP2 members (n = 191), representing 147 institutions and 60 countries across 6 continents, completed the survey. Access to clinical genetic testing services was significantly higher in high-income countries compared with low- and middle-income countries (96.6% vs 58.4%), where funding was predominantly covered by patients themselves. While 92.7% of the respondents agreed that genetic research results should be returned, levels of agreement were higher for clinically relevant results relating to pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in genes known to cause PD or other neurodegenerative diseases. Less than 10% offered separate clinically accredited genetic testing before returning genetic research results. A total of 48.7% reported having a specific statement on RoR policy in their ethics consent form, while 53.9% collected data on participants' preferences on RoR prospectively. 24.1% had formal genetic counselling training. Notably, the comfort level in returning incidental genetic findings or returning results to unaffected individuals remains low.DiscussionGiven the differences in resources and training for RoR, as well as ethical and regulatory considerations, tailored approaches are required to ensure equitable access to RoR. Several identified strategies to enhance RoR practices include improving informed consent processes, increasing capacity for genetic counselling including providing counselling toolkits for common genetic variants, broadening access to sustainable clinically accredited testing, building logistical infrastructure for RoR processes, and continuing public and health care education efforts on the important role of genetics in PD.",1,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,18,18,21100865008,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,3,NA,ASAP,Aligning Science Across Parkinson's,e200213,NA

To test this hypothesis, we examined whether plasma biomarkers of AD pathology (Aβ42/40, phosphorylated tau [pTau-181]), astrogliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), and neuronal injury (neurofilament light chain [NfL]) related to longitudinal changes in resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in cognitively unimpaired participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Method: Baseline plasma biomarkers were measured with Quanterix SIMOA assays. Functional connectivity (3T resting-state fMRI) was derived using a predefined cortical parcellation mask from which intra-network connectivity from seven functional networks was extracted for each participant. Amyloid status (positive/negative) was defined using plasma Aβ42/40 (Figure 1). Linear mixed effects models adjusted for age, sex, race, education, gray matter volume, and time-covariate interactions were used to determine whether 1) baseline plasma biomarkers predicted longitudinal changes in rsFC, 2) the magnitude of the biomarker-related rsFC changes differed by amyloid status, and 3) rsFC predicted longitudinal changes in cognition. Result: Longitudinal connectivity analyses (mean age±SD=65.49±16.17) included 490 participants (1190 visits; mean follow-up time=4.31±1.68 years). Higher Aβ42/40, GFAP, and NfL were associated with faster declines in rsFC within several networks (P-range=0.01-0.04; Figure 2). Overall, plasma biomarker-rsFC associations differed by amyloid status (P-range=0.01-0.045). Among amyloid-positive participants, lower levels of Aβ42/40, and higher levels of GFAP, and NfL (Figure 2) were associated with faster declines in rsFC in the visual, dorsal and ventral attention, limbic, and frontoparietal networks (P range=<0.002-0.04). There were no statistically significant associations between plasma biomarkers and rsFC change among amyloid-negative participants. Among 760 participants with at least one rsFC scan (mean age±SD=67.21±14.93; 1550 visits, follow-up time=3.94±1.60 years), we found that baseline rsFC in several networks predicted changes in cognition, e.g., working memory, verbal fluency, and visuospatial abilities (P range=0.02-0.049; Figure 3).

We used Cox proportional hazards models and four-way decomposition models to analyze sleep patterns and global mental status. RESULTS: After a median time at risk of 8.2 years, 172 deaths occurred, with rate of 16 per 1000 person-years. A 1-unit increase in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global score was linked to a 7% increase in mortality risk in the reduced model, but this effect was attenuated in the full model. In both reduced and fully adjusted models, the PSQI global score and sleep quality domains interacted with global mental status, with poor sleep generally associated with mortality risk in the group with better global mental status at first-visit. In four-way decomposition models, total effects (TE) of PSQI scores on mortality risk were positive and statistically significant, while being mostly controlled direct effects. However, among women, the inverse TE of global mental status on mortality risk was partially mediated by PSQI sleep latency and the PSQI global.

At normal cerebral blood flow, this limit falls at the lower end of lipophilicity for most FDA-approved CNS drugs. In this study, we report on two methods that can be used to overcome this limitation and measure brain vascular permeability values that are up to ~1000 times higher using the in situ brain perfusion technique. Methods: Rat brain was perfused with physiological saline at increased flow rate and in the presence of various concentrations of plasma protein, serum albumin or alpha-acid glycoprotein. Plasma protein was added to the saline perfusion fluid to lower extraction into the measurable range using the Crone Renkin “diffusion-flow” equation to calculate brain PoS. Results: Cerebrovascular Po was determined for 125 solutes, of which 78 showed little or no evidence of active efflux transport. Fifty of the solutes were in the lipophilicity zone (Log Poct 1–5) of most FDA-approved CNS drugs. Care was taken to ensure the integrity of the brain vasculature during perfusion and to measure flow accurately using markers that had been verified for the flow rates. The results showed a linear relationship between Log Po and Log Poct over ~10 orders of magnitude with values for diazepam, estradiol, testosterone, and other agents that exceed prior published values by fivefold to 200-fold. Conclusions: The results show that brain vascular permeability can be measured directly in vivo for highly lipophilic solutes and the PS values obtained match reasonably with that predicted by the Crone-Renkin flow diffusion equation with care taken to validate the accuracy for the component measurements and with no need to invoke “enhanced” or “induced” dissociation.",0,39690422,Journal,ar,Article,100,11,11,19900193571,5RO1 NS052484,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,11,Albumin | Alpha-1 acid glycoprotein | Blood brain barrier | Diazepam | Enhanced dissociation | Neurovascular unit | Pharmaceutical screening,NIH,National Institutes of Health,100,NA

This variant (rs3115534-G) is carried by ~50% of West African PD cases and imparts a dose-dependent increase in risk for disease. The risk variant has varied frequencies across African ancestry groups but is almost absent in European and Asian ancestry populations. GBA1 is a gene of high clinical and therapeutic interest. Damaging biallelic protein-coding variants cause Gaucher disease and monoallelic variants confer risk for PD and dementia with Lewy bodies, likely by reducing the function of glucocerebrosidase. Interestingly, the African ancestry-specific GBA1 risk variant is a noncoding variant, suggesting a different mechanism of action. Using full-length RNA transcript sequencing, we identified partial intron 8 expression in risk variant carriers (G) but not in nonvariant carriers (T). Antibodies targeting the N terminus of glucocerebrosidase showed that this intron-retained isoform is likely not protein coding and subsequent proteomics did not identify a shorter protein isoform, suggesting that the disease mechanism is RNA based. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats editing of the reported index variant (rs3115534) revealed that this is the sequence alteration responsible for driving the production of these transcripts containing intron 8. Follow-up analysis of this variant showed that it is in a key intronic branchpoint sequence and, therefore, has important implications in splicing and disease. In addition, when measuring glucocerebrosidase activity, we identified a dose-dependent reduction in risk variant carriers. Overall, we report the functional effect of a GBA1 noncoding risk variant, which acts by interfering with the splicing of functional GBA1 transcripts, resulting in reduced protein levels and reduced glucocerebrosidase activity.

For hPDI, the intermediate tertile showed the greatest benefit, with SPPB scores 0.5 points higher (βT2vs.T1 = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.30–0.70, p < 0.001) over the follow-up period. In contrast, for uPDI, a 0.27-point lower SPPB score was seen (βT3vs.T1 = −0.27, 95% CI: −0.48 to −0.07, p = 0.009). Longitudinally, grip strength was positively associated with hPDI (βT3vs.T1 = 1.14, 95% CI: 0.24–2.05, p = 0.0013). Similar results were observed in older adults aged ≥65 years. Conclusions: Adherence to hPDI may benefit lower body function and muscle strength, while uPDI appears to have adverse effects. This suggests that the quality of plant-based foods is essential for maintaining functional well-being in older adults. Further research is needed to confirm these findings, explore underlying mechanisms, and identify strategies to optimize plant-based dietary patterns for aging populations.",2,39683645,Journal,ar,Article,100,9,9,19700188323,K01AG078545,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,13,aging | gait speed | grip strength | muscle mass | muscle strength | nutrition | older adults | physical function | short physical performance battery,NIH,National Institutes of Health,4249,NA

We recently proposed a theoretical premise by which age-related reductions in Achilles tendon stiffness (kAT) can disrupt the neuromechanics of calf muscle force production and contribute to faster rates of oxygen consumption during walking. The purpose of this study was to objectively evaluate this premise. We quantified kAT at a range of matched relative activations prescribed using electromyographic biofeedback and walking metabolic cost and ankle joint biomechanics in a group of 15 younger (age: 23 ± 4 yr) and 15 older (age: 72 ± 5 yr) adults. Older adults averaged 44% lower kAT than younger adults at matched triceps surae activations during isokinetic dorsiflexion tasks on a dynamometer (P = 0.046). Older adults also walked with a 17% higher net metabolic power (P = 0.017) but indistinguishable peak Achilles tendon forces than younger adults. Thus, data implicate altered tendon length-tension relations with age more than differences in the operating region of those length-tension relations between younger and older adults. In addition, we discovered empirical evidence that lesser kAT-likely due to the shorter muscle lengths and thus higher relative activations it imposes-was positively correlated with higher net metabolic power during walking (r = -0.365, P = 0.048). These results pave the way for interventions focused on restoring ankle muscle-tendon unit structural stiffness to improve walking energetics in aging.

This case-cohort study used targeted plasma biomarkers and large-scale proteomics to examine the biological mechanisms that allow some APOEε4 carriers to maintain normal cognitive functioning in older adulthood. Methods: APOEε4 carriers and APOEε3 homozygotes enrolled in the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) from 1996 to 1999 were classified as resilient if they remained cognitively unimpaired beyond age 80, and as non-resilient if they developed cognitive impairment before or at age 80. AD pathology (Aß42/40) and neurodegeneration (NfL, tau) biomarkers, as well as 1007 proteins (Olink) were quantified in blood collected at study enrollment (on average 14 years prior) when participants were cognitively normal. We identified plasma proteins that distinguished between resilient and non-resilient APOEε4 carriers, examined whether these associations generalized to APOEε3 homozygotes, and replicated these findings in the UK Biobank. Results: A total of 1610 participants were included (baseline age: 71.3 [3.8 SD] years; all White; 42% APOEε4 carriers). Compared to resilient APOEε4 carriers, non-resilient APOEε4 carriers had lower Aß42/40/tau ratio and greater NfL at baseline. Proteomic analyses identified four proteins differentially expressed between resilient and non-resilient APOEε4 carriers at an FDR-corrected P < 0.05. While one of the candidate proteins, a marker of neuronal injury (NfL), also distinguished resilient from non-resilient APOEε3 homozygotes, the other three proteins, known to be involved in lipid metabolism (ANGPTL4) and immune signaling (PTX3, NCR1), only predicted resilient vs. non-resilient status among APOEε4 carriers (protein*genotype interaction-P < 0.05). Three of these four proteins also predicted 14-year dementia risk among APOEε4 carriers in the UK Biobank validation sample (N = 9420). While the candidate proteins showed little to no association with targeted biomarkers of AD pathology, protein network and enrichment analyses suggested that natural killer (NK) cell and T lymphocyte signaling (via PKC-θ) distinguished resilient from non-resilient APOEε4 carriers. Conclusions: We identified and replicated a plasma proteomic signature associated with cognitive resilience among APOEε4 carriers.

Dysfunctional mitophagy has been implicated in human aging and diseases. Multiple evolutionarily selected, redundant mechanisms of mitophagy have been identified, but their specific roles in human health and their potential exploitation as therapeutic targets are unclear. Recently, the characterization of the endosomal−lysosomal system has revealed additional mechanisms of mitophagy and mitochondrial quality control that operate via the production of mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs). Circulating MDVs can be isolated and characterized to provide an unprecedented opportunity to study this type of mitochondrial recycling in vivo and to relate it to human physiology and pathology. Defining the role of MDVs in human physiology, pathology, and aging is hampered by the lack of standardized methods to isolate, validate, and characterize these vesicles. Hence, some basic questions about MDVs remain unanswered. While MDVs are generated directly through the extrusion of mitochondrial membranes within the cell, a set of circulating extracellular vesicles leaking from the endosomal−lysosomal system and containing mitochondrial portions have also been identified and warrant investigation. Preliminary research indicates that MDV generation serves multiple biological roles and contributes to restoring cell homeostasis. However, studies have shown that MDVs may also be involved in pathological conditions. Therefore, further research is warranted to establish when/whether MDVs are supporting disease progression and/or are extracting damaged mitochondrial components to alleviate cellular oxidative burden and restore redox homeoastasis. This information will be relevant for exploiting these vesicles for therapeutic purpose. Herein, we provide an overview of preclinical and clinical studies on MDVs in aging and associated conditions and discuss the interplay between MDVs and some of the hallmarks of aging (mitophagy, inflammation, and proteostasis).

METHODS: A total of 1637 cross-sectional and 407 longitudinal CSF samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were tested with SAA. We examined longitudinal dynamics of amyloid beta (Aβ), α-syn seeds, and phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181), along with global and domain-specific cognition in stable SAA+, stable SAA−, and those who converted to SAA+ from SAA−. RESULTS: SAA+ individuals had faster cognitive decline than SAA−, notably in mild cognitive impairment, and presented with earlier symptom onset. SAA+ conversion was associated with CSF Aβ42 positivity but did not impact the progression of either CSF Aβ42 or CSF p-tau181 status. CSF Aβ42, p-tau181, and α-syn SAA were all strong predictors of clinical progression, particularly CSF Aβ42. In vitro, CSF α-syn SAA kinetic parameters were associated with participant demographics, clinical profiles, and cognitive decline. DISCUSSION: These results highlight the interplay between amyloid and α-syn and their association with disease progression. Highlights: Seed amplification assay (SAA) positivity was associated with greater cognitive decline and earlier symptom onset. Thirty-four Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) individuals progressed from SAA− to SAA+, that is, ≈ 5% conversion. SAA conversion was associated with amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology and greater cognitive decline. SAA status did not impact the progression of either CSF Aβ42 or phosphorylated tau181 biomarkers. Change in clinical diagnosis was associated with both Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and SAA.

Studies have reported associations between iron dysregulation and certain cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, but the direction of influence is not clear. Our goal was to use computational approaches to better understand the role of genetically predicted iron levels on disease risk. We meta-analyzed genome-wide association study summary statistics for serum iron levels from two cohorts and two previous meta-analyses. We then obtained summary statistics from 11 neurodegenerative, cerebrovascular, cardiovascular or lipid traits to assess global and regional genetic correlation between iron levels and these traits. We used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate causal effects. Sex-stratified analyses were also carried out to identify effects potentially differing by sex. Overall, we identified three significant global correlations between iron levels and (i) coronary heart disease, (ii) triglycerides, and (iii) high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. A total of 194 genomic regions had significant (after correction for multiple testing) local correlations between iron levels and the 11 tested traits. MR analysis revealed two potential causal relationships, between genetically predicted iron levels and (i) total cholesterol or (ii) non-HDL cholesterol. Sex-stratified analyses suggested a potential protective effect of iron levels on Parkinson’s disease risk in females, but not in males.

We employed a semi-supervised representation learning technique known as Surreal-GAN, through which we identified two latent dimensional representations of brain atrophy in symptomatic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients: the “diffuse-AD” (R1) dimension shows widespread brain atrophy, and the “MTL-AD” (R2) dimension displays focal medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy. Critically, only R2 was associated with widely known sporadic AD genetic risk factors (e.g., APOE ε4) in MCI and AD patients at baseline. We then independently detected the presence of the two dimensions in the early stages by deploying the trained model in the general population and two cognitively unimpaired cohorts of asymptomatic participants. In the general population, genome-wide association studies found 77 genes unrelated to APOE differentially associated with R1 and R2. Functional analyses revealed that these genes were overrepresented in differentially expressed gene sets in organs beyond the brain (R1 and R2), including the heart (R1) and the pituitary gland, muscle, and kidney (R2). These genes were enriched in biological pathways implicated in dendritic cells (R2), macrophage functions (R1), and cancer (R1 and R2). Several of them were “druggable genes” for cancer (R1), inflammation (R1), cardiovascular diseases (R1), and diseases of the nervous system (R2). The longitudinal progression showed that APOEε4, amyloid, and tau were associated with R2 at early asymptomatic stages, but this longitudinal association occurs only at late symptomatic stages in R1. Our findings deepen our understanding of the multifaceted pathogenesis of AD beyond the brain. In early asymptomatic stages, the two dimensions are associated with diverse pathological mechanisms, including cardiovascular diseases, inflammation, and hormonal dysfunction—driven by genes different from APOE—which may collectively contribute to the early pathogenesis of AD.

Immunohistochemical results showed that NN administration significantly mitigated astrogliosis and microgliosis in the CPu and SNc of mice receiving subacute MPTP treatment, with region-specific variations in anti-inflammatory efficacy. Remarkably, the CPu showed a heightened response to NN treatment, including a pronounced decrease in microglial IL-1β and TNF-α production.

This study aims to shed light on the impacts of WDR45-deficiency on neurodegeneration, specifically axonal degeneration, within the midbrain dopaminergic (DAergic) system. We hope to better understand the disease process by examining pathological and molecular alterations, especially within the DAergic system. Methods: To investigate the impacts of WDR45 dysfunction on mouse behaviors and DAergic neurons, we developed a mouse model in which WDR45 was conditionally knocked out in the midbrain DAergic neurons (WDR45cKO). Through a longitudinal study, we assessed alterations in the mouse behaviors using open field, rotarod, Y-maze, and 3-chamber social approach tests. We utilized a combination of immunofluorescence staining and transmission electron microscopy to examine the pathological changes in DAergic neuron soma and axons. Additionally, we performed proteomic and lipidomic analyses of the striatum from young and aged mice to identify the molecules and processes potentially involved in the striatal pathology during aging. Further more, primary midbrain neuronal culture was employed to explore the molecular mechanisms leading to axonal degeneration. Results: Our study of WDR45cKO mice revealed a range of deficits, including impaired motor function, emotional instability, and memory loss, coinciding with the profound reduction of midbrain DAergic neurons. The neuronal loss, we observed massive axonal enlargements in the dorsal and ventral striatum. These enlargements were characterized by the accumulation of extensively fragmented tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a hallmark of axonal degeneration. Proteomic analysis of the striatum showed that the differentially expressed proteins were enriched in metabolic processes. The carbohydrate metabolic and protein catabolic processes appeared earlier, and amino acid, lipid, and tricarboxylic acid metabolisms were increased during aging. Of note, we observed a tremendous increase in the expression of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (Lpcat1) that regulates phospholipid metabolism, specifically in the conversion of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the presence of acyl-CoA. The lipidomic results consistently suggested that differential lipids were concentrated on PC and LPC. Axonal degeneration was effectively ameliorated by interfering Lpcat1 expression in primary cultured WDR45-deficient DAergic neurons, proving that Lpcat1 and its regulated lipid metabolism, especially PC and LPC metabolism, participate in controlling the axonal degeneration induced by WDR45 deficits. Conclusions: In this study, we uncovered the molecular mechanisms underlying the contribution of WDR45 deficiency to axonal degeneration, which involves complex relationships between phospholipid metabolism, autophagy, and tubular ER. These findings greatly advance our understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms driving axonal degeneration and may provide a foundation for developing novel mechanistically based therapeutic interventions for BPAN and other neurodegenerative diseases.",4,39183331,Journal,ar,Article,100,11,11,5700191214,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,41,Autophagy | Axonal degeneration | Lpcat1 | Phospholipid metabolism | Tubular ER | WDR45,DMU,Dalian Medical University,62,NA

Here, we identify an evolutionarily conserved FOXO target gene, Oxidative stress-responsive serine-rich protein 1 (OSER1), whose overexpression extends lifespan in silkworms, nematodes, and flies, while its depletion correspondingly shortens lifespan. In flies, overexpression of OSER1 increases resistance to oxidative stress, starvation, and heat shock, while OSER1-depleted flies are more vulnerable to these stressors. In silkworms, hydrogen peroxide both induces and is scavenged by OSER1 in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of OSER1 in Caenorhabditis elegans leads to increased ROS production and shorter lifespan, mitochondrial fragmentation, decreased ATP production, and altered transcription of mitochondrial genes. Human proteomic analysis suggests that OSER1 plays roles in oxidative stress response, cellular senescence, and reproduction, which is consistent with the data and suggests that OSER1 could play a role in fertility in silkworms and nematodes. Human studies demonstrate that polymorphic variants in OSER1 are associated with human longevity. In summary, OSER1 is an evolutionarily conserved FOXO-regulated protein that improves resistance to oxidative stress, maintains mitochondrial functional integrity, and increases lifespan in multiple species. Additional studies will clarify the role of OSER1 as a critical effector of healthy aging.",8,39164296,Journal,ar,Article,100,15,15,19700182758,2023-RC180-03,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,42,NA,AXA,AXA Research Fund,7144,NA

Our results showed that AsymAD cases exhibit enrichment in core plaques, decreased filamentous plaque accumulation, and increased plaque-surrounding microglia. Less pathological tau aggregation in dystrophic neurites was found in AsymAD brains than in AD brains, and tau seeding activity was comparable to that in healthy brains. We used spatial transcriptomics to characterize the plaque niche further and revealed autophagy, endocytosis, and phagocytosis as the pathways associated with the genes upregulated in the AsymAD plaque niche. Furthermore, the levels of ARP2 and CAP1, which are actin-based motility proteins that participate in the dynamics of actin filaments to allow cell motility, were increased in the microglia surrounding amyloid plaques in AsymAD cases. Our findings suggest that the amyloid-plaque microenvironment in AsymAD cases is characterized by the presence of microglia with highly efficient actin-based cell motility mechanisms and decreased tau seeding compared with that in AD brains.

While much progress has been made, most of the heritability remains unknown. This is in-part because previous genetic studies have focused on the contribution of single nucleotide variants. More complex forms of variation, such as structural variants and tandem repeats, are already associated with several synucleinopathies. However, because more sophisticated sequencing methods are usually required to detect these regions, little is understood regarding their contribution to PD. One example is a polymorphic CT-rich region in intron 4 of the SNCA gene. This haplotype has been suggested to be associated with risk of Lewy Body (LB) pathology in Alzheimer’s Disease and SNCA gene expression, but is yet to be investigated in PD. Here, we attempt to resolve this CT-rich haplotype and investigate its role in PD. We performed targeted PacBio HiFi sequencing of the region in 1375 PD cases and 959 controls. We replicate the previously reported associations and a novel association between two PD risk SNVs (rs356182 and rs5019538) and haplotype 4, the largest haplotype.

We described the clinical findings, natural history, and molecular analyses of USH patients identified during a large-scale screening to identify quantitative traits related to ocular disorders in the SardiNIA project cohort. Methods: We identified 3 USH-affected families out of a cohort of 6,148 healthy subjects. 9 subjects presented a pathological phenotype, with SNHL and RP. All patients and their family members underwent a complete ophthalmic examination including best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, fundoscopy, fundus autofluorescence, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, and electrophysiological testing. Audiological evaluation was performed with a clinical audiometer. Genotyping was performed using several arrays integrated with whole genome sequence data providing approximately 22 million markers equally distributed for each subject analyzed. Molecular diagnostics focused on analysis of the following candidate genes: MYO7A, USH1C, CDH23, PCDH15, USH1G, CIB2, USH2A, GPR98, DFNB31, CLRN1, and PDZD7. Results: A single missense causal variant in USH2A gene was identified in homozygous status in all patients and in heterozygous status in unaffected parents. The presence of multiple homozygous patients with the same phenotypic severity of the syndromic form suggests that the Sardinian USH phenotype is the result of a founder effect on a specific pathogenic variant related haplotype. The frequency of heterozygotes in general Sardinian population is 1.89. Additionally, to provide new insights into the structure of usherin and the pathological mechanisms caused by small pathogenic in-frame variants, like p.Pro3272Leu, molecular dynamics simulations of native and mutant protein–protein and protein–ligand complexes were performed that predicted a destabilization of the protein with a decrease in the free energy change. Conclusions: Our results suggest that our approach is effective for the genetic diagnosis of USH. Based on the heterozygous frequency, targeted screening of this variant in the general population and in families at risk or with familial USH can be suggested. This can lead to more accurate molecular diagnosis, better genetic counseling, and improved molecular epidemiology data that are critical for future intervention plans.

Among 459 participants (mean age 68 years; 55% women) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, mitochondrial function was quantified as skeletal muscle oxidative capacity via post-exercise phosphocreatine recovery rate (τPCr) in the vastus lateralis muscle of the left thigh, using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Accelerometry was collected using a 7-day, 24-h wrist-worn protocol and summarized into activity amount, intensity, endurance, and accumulation patterning metrics. Linear regression, two-part linear and logistic (bout analyses), and linear mixed effects models (time-of-day analyses) were used to estimate associations between τPCr and each physical activity metric. Interactions by age, sex, and gait speed were tested. After covariate adjustment, higher τPCr (or poorer mitochondrial function) was associated with lower activity counts/day (β = − 6593.7, SE = 2406.0; p = 0.006) and activity intensity (− 81.5 counts, SE = 12.9; p < 0.001). For activity intensity, the magnitude of association was greater for men and those with slower gait speed (interaction p < 0.02 for both). Conversely, τPCr was not associated with daily active minutes/day (p = 0.15), activity fragmentation (p = 0.13), or endurance at any bout length (p > 0.05 for all). Time-of-day analyses show participants with high τPCr were less active from 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. than those with low τPCr. Results indicate that poorer skeletal mitochondrial function is primarily associated with lower engagement in high intensity activities.

This study aimed to test the association of retinal microvascular abnormalities in mid and late life and late life cerebral amyloid. Methods: Participants from the ARIC‐PET (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities‐Positron Emission Tomography) study with a valid retinal measure (N = 285) were included. The associations of mid- and late-life retinal signs with late-life amyloid-β (Aβ) by florbetapir PET were tested. Two different measures of Aβ burden were included: (1) elevated amyloid (SUVR > 1.2) and (2) continuous amyloid SUVR. The retinal measures’ association with Aβ burden was assessed using logistic and robust linear regression models. A newly created retinal score, incorporating multiple markers of retinal abnormalities, was also evaluated in association with greater Aβ burden. Results: Retinopathy in midlife (OR (95% CI) = 0.36 (0.08, 1.40)) was not significantly associated with elevated amyloid burden. In late life, retinopathy was associated with increased continuous amyloid standardized value uptake ratio (SUVR) (β (95%CI) = 0.16 (0.02, 0.32)) but not elevated amyloid burden (OR (95%CI) = 2.37 (0.66, 9.88)) when accounting for demographic, genetic and clinical risk factors. A high retinal score in late life, indicating a higher burden of retinal abnormalities, was also significantly associated with increased continuous amyloid SUVR (β (95% CI) = 0.16 (0.04, 0.32)) independent of vascular risk factors.

Using data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), we examined whether plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology (amyloid-β [Aβ42/40], phosphorylated tau [pTau-181]), astrogliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), and neuronal injury (neurofilament light chain [NfL]) were associated with longitudinal brain volume loss and cognitive decline. Additionally, we determined whether sex, APOEε4 status, and plasma amyloid-β status modified these associations. Methods: Plasma biomarkers were measured using Quanterix SIMOA assays. Regional brain volumes were measured by 3T MRI, and a battery of neuropsychological tests assessed five cognitive domains. Linear mixed effects models adjusted for demographic factors, kidney function, and intracranial volume (MRI analyses) were completed to relate baseline plasma biomarkers to baseline and longitudinal brain volume and cognitive performance. Results: Brain volume analyses included 622 participants (mean age ± SD: 70.9 ± 10.2) with an average of 3.3 MRI scans over 4.7 years. Cognitive performance analyses included 674 participants (mean age ± SD: 71.2 ± 10.0) with an average of 3.9 cognitive assessments over 5.7 years. Higher baseline pTau-181 was associated with steeper declines in total gray matter volume and steeper regional declines in several medial temporal regions, whereas higher baseline GFAP was associated with greater longitudinal increases in ventricular volume. Baseline Aβ42/40 and NfL levels were not associated with changes in brain volume. Lower baseline Aβ42/40 (higher Aβ burden) was associated with a faster decline in verbal memory and visuospatial performance, whereas higher baseline GFAP was associated with a faster decline in verbal fluency. Results were generally consistent across sex and APOEε4 status. However, the associations of higher pTau-181 with increasing ventricular volume and memory declines were significantly stronger among individuals with higher Aβ burden, as was the association of higher GFAP with memory decline.

To evaluate the potential of targeting NKT cells to modulate neuroinflammation, we treated α-syn transgenic (tg) mice (e.g.: Thy1 promoter line 61) with an antibody against CD1d, which is a glycoprotein expressed in antigen presenting cells (APCs). CD1d-presented lipid antigens activate NKT cells through the interaction with T cell receptor in NKTs, resulting in the production of cytokines. Thus, we hypothesized that blocking the APC-NKT interaction with an anti-CD1d antibody might reduce neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in models of DLB/PD. Treatment with the anti-CD1d antibody did not have effects on CD3 (T cells), slightly decreased CD4 and increased CD8 lymphocytes in the mice. Moreover, double labeling studies showed that compared to control (IgG) treated α-syn tg mice, treatment with anti-CD1d decreased numbers of CD3/interferon γ (IFN γ)-positive cells, consistent with NKTs. Further double labeling studies showed that CD1d-positive cells co-localized with the astrocytes marker GFAP and that anti-CD1d antibody reduced this effect. While in control α-syn tg mice CD3 positive cells were near astrocytes, this was modified by the treatment with the CD1d antibody. By qPCR, levels of IFN γ, CCL4, and interleukin-6 were increased in the IgG treated α-syn tg mice. Treatment with CD1d antibody blunted this cytokine response that was associated with reduced astrocytosis and microgliosis in the CNS of the α-syn tg mice treated with CD1d antibody. Flow cytometric analysis of immune cells in α-syn tg mice revealed that CD1d-tet + T cells were also increased in the spleen of α-syn tg mice, which treatment with the CD1d antibody reduced. Reduced neuroinflammation in the anti-CD1d-treated α-syn tg mice was associated with amelioration of neurodegenerative pathology. These results suggest that reducing infiltration of NKT cells with an antibody against CD1d might be a potential therapeutical approach for DLB/PD.",1,38622654,Journal,ar,Article,100,10,10,50032,1ZIAAG000936,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,63,Adaptive immunity | Dementia with Lewy bodies | Innate immunity | Parkinson’s disease | T cell | α-synuclein,NIMH,National Institute of Mental Health,93,NA

Patients with lower ergothioneine levels had a 12% higher rate of AD progression with the significance of P = 0.012 (Wald test). Furthermore, an increase in ganglioside (GM3) and decrease in plasmalogen lipids, many of which are associated with apolipoprotein E polymorphism, were confirmed in AD patients, and the higher levels of lysophosphatidylcholine (18:1) and GM3 d18:1/20:0 showed 19% and 17% higher rates of AD progression, respectively (Wald test: P = 3.9 × 10–8 and 4.3 × 10–7).

We examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships of depressive symptoms and/or antidepressant use with WBC count among postmenopausal women. Analyses of cross-sectional data at enrollment were performed on 125,307 participants, 50–79 years of age, from the Women’s Health Initiative Clinical Trials and Observational Studies who met eligibility criteria, and a subset of those with 3-year follow-up data were examined for longitudinal relationships. Depressive symptoms were defined using the Burnam Algorithm whereas antidepressant use was defined using therapeutic class codes. WBC count (Kcell/ml) was obtained through laboratory evaluations of fasting blood samples. Multivariable regression modeling was performed taking sociodemographic, lifestyle and health characteristics into consideration. At enrollment, nearly 85% were non-users of antidepressants with no depressive symptoms, 5% were antidepressant users with no depressive symptoms, 9% were non-users of antidepressants with depressive symptoms, and 2% were users of antidepressants with depressive symptoms.

Compared to women who exhibited no depressive symptoms at either visit, those with consistent depressive symptoms at enrollment and at 3-year follow-up had faster decline in WBC count (β = −0.73, 95% CI: −1.33, −0.14) over time. No significant bidirectional relationships were observed between changes in depressive symptoms score and WBC count over time.

Here, we carried out an exploratory study in plasma from HD individuals over a 3-year time frame to assess whether differences exist between those with fast or absent clinical progression. There were more differences in circulating metabolite levels for fast progressors compared to absent progressors (111 vs 20, nominal p < 0.05). All metabolite changes in faster progressors were decreases, whereas some metabolite concentrations increased in absent progressors. Many of the metabolite levels that decreased in the fast progressors were higher at Screening compared to absent progressors but ended up lower by Year 3. Changes in faster progression suggest greater oxidative stress and inflammation (kynurenine, diacylglycerides, cysteine), disturbances in nitric oxide and urea metabolism (arginine, citrulline, ornithine, GABR), lower polyamines (putrescine and spermine), elevated glucose, and deficient AMPK signaling.

Here, we have used CRISPR-mediated deletion of the LRIG2 SVA in a cell line model to validate that presence of the retrotransposon is directly affecting local expression and provide evidence that is suggestive of a modest role for the SVA in modulating nearby methylation. Additionally, in leveraging an available Hi-C dataset we observed that the LRIG2 SVA was also involved in long-range chromatin interactions with a cluster of genes ~ 300 kb away, and that expression of these genes was to varying degrees associated with dosage of the SVA in both CRISPR cell line and population models.

Here, by fusing a removable short signal peptide to the N-terminus of αSyn, we developed a novel mouse model with enhanced αSyn secretion and cell-to-cell transmission. Expression of the secreted αSyn in the mouse brain was under the control of a novel hybrid promoter in combination with adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9). This combination of promoter and viral vector induced a robust expression in neurons but not in the glia of injected mice. Biochemical characterization of the secreted αSyn revealed that, in cultured cells, this protein is released to the extracellular milieu via conventional secretion. The released αSyn is then internalized and processed by acceptor cells via the endosome–lysosome pathway indicating that the secreted αSyn is cell-to-cell transmitted. The secreted αSyn is aggregation-prone and amyloidogenic, and when expressed in the brain of wild-type non-transgenic mice, it induces a Parkinson’s disease-like phenotype that includes a robust αSyn pathology in the substantia nigra, neuronal loss, neuroinflammation, and motor deficits, all the key features of experimental animal models of Parkinson’s disease.

We present vector field attention (VFA), a novel framework that enhances the efficiency of the existing network design by enabling direct retrieval of location correspondences. Approach: VFA uses neural networks to extract multi-resolution feature maps from the fixed and moving images and then retrieves pixel-level correspondences based on feature similarity. The retrieval is achieved with a novel attention module without the need for learnable parameters. VFA is trained end-to-end in either a supervised or unsupervised manner.

Model simulations revealed that heterogeneities in both CRU sizes and locations facilitate CICR and increase the AP firing rate in a cooperative manner. However, these heterogeneities reduce the effect of β-adrenergic stimulation in terms of its relative change in AP firing rate. The presence of heterogeneities in both sizes and locations allows SANC to reach higher absolute AP firing rates during β-adrenergic stimulation. Thus, the CICR facilitation by heterogeneities in CRU sizes and locations regulates and optimizes cardiac pacemaker cell operation under various physiological conditions. Dysfunction of this optimization could be a key factor in heart rate reserve decline in aging and disease.",0,39594633,Journal,ar,Article,100,11,11,21100978391,RF/ERE/21005,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,99,numerical model | pacemaker function | ryanodine receptor | sinoatrial node | β adrenergic stimulation,UMBC,"University of Maryland, Baltimore County",1885,NA

To better understand the EV origin and function, it is important to develop methods that reveal surface protein composition of heterogeneous EV populations in culture supernatants and in biofluids. Tetraspanins CD9, CD63, and CD81 are common and abundant EV markers. However, their relative enrichment (profile) on EVs of specific cellular origins is not fully elucidated. We introduce LuminEV, a novel version of the Luminex assay for the multiplexed analysis of EV surface proteins. Optimized LuminEV reagents enable direct, specific, and sensitive measurements of EV markers in biofluids and in culture supernatants, bypassing EV isolation step. LuminEV assay for CD9, CD63, and CD81 was validated by comparing simplex and multiplex measurements, establishing linearity, spike-in recovery, inter- and intra-assay precision, and reproducibility between operators. LuminEV measurements of CD9, CD63, and CD81 in conditioned media from 15 cell lines revealed strong variations between cell types and showed high sensitivity, which enabled EV detection without prior concentration. Using tetraspanin levels as a readout, we noted suppression and induction of EV release from the cultured cells by GW6869 and monensin. Measurement of EV CD9, CD63, and CD81 in blood plasma from 70 disease-free donors showed respective abundance of 72, 16, and 12%. CD63 displayed weak, albeit significant, negative correlation with age and was slightly lower in female samples. The assay was then used to detect cell type-specific EV surface markers, including CD235a (erythrocytes), GAP43 (neurons), and CD68 (macrophages), and to detect differences in tetraspanin profiles between healthy and diseased donors.

Whether different levels of body-mass-index (BMI) are needed to define diabetes risk across the adult lifespan is unknown. Objective: This work aimed to investigate whether BMI similarly reflects relative fat mass (FM) and diabetes risk across age groups. Methods: Participants without diabetes from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (973 men, 1073 women), stratified by age (<50, 50-59, 60-69, ≥70 years) and categorized by either World Health Organization (WHO)-defined BMI categories (for normal weight, overweight or obesity) or BMI quartiles. The primary exposure was BMI. The primary outcome was diabetes incidence. The relationship of BMI to dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry–derived FM was also investigated in older vs younger participants. Results: The median (range) follow-up time was 7.1 years (range, 0-29.0 years). Within WHO-defined BMI categories, different age groups demonstrated significantly different FM percentage, FM/lean mass, and waist circumference (P < .05). WHO-defined BMI categories for overweight and obesity were generally related to higher diabetes risk compared to normal weight in all ages except 50 to 59 years. When BMI was categorized by quartiles, diabetes incidence increased dramatically beginning in quartile 2 (23-25 kg/m2) in older groups. BMI cutoffs with equivalent diabetes incidence rate as BMI 25 kg/m2 and 30.0 kg/m2 in individuals younger than 50 years were 22.7 kg/m2 and 25.2 kg/m2 for ages 50 to 59 years; 22.8 kg/m2 and 25.0 kg/m2 for ages 60 to 69 years; and 23.2 kg/m2 and 25.8 kg/m2 for ages 70 years and older, respectively.

These processes may differentially affect structural and functional brain ageing across individuals, with more pronounced ageing (older brain age) during midlife being indicative of later development of dementia. Here, we examined whether brain-ageing heterogeneity in unimpaired older adults related to neurodegeneration, different cognitive trajectories, genetic and amyloid-beta (Aβ) profiles, and to predicted progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: Functional and structural brain age measures were obtained for resting-state functional MRI and structural MRI, respectively, in 3460 cognitively normal individuals across an age range spanning 42–85 years. Participants were categorised into four groups based on the difference between their chronological and predicted age in each modality: advanced age in both (n = 291), resilient in both (n = 260) or advanced in one/resilient in the other (n = 163/153). With the resilient group as the reference, brain-age groups were compared across neuroimaging features of neuropathology (white matter hyperintensity volume, neuronal loss measured with Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging, AD-specific atrophy patterns measured with the Spatial Patterns of Abnormality for Recognition of Early Alzheimer's Disease index, amyloid burden using amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), progression to mild cognitive impairment and baseline and longitudinal cognitive measures (trail making task, mini mental state examination, digit symbol substitution task). Findings: Individuals with advanced structural and functional brain-ages had more features indicative of neurodegeneration and they had poor cognition. Individuals with a resilient brain-age in both modalities had a genetic variant that has been shown to be associated with age of onset of AD. Mixed brain-age was associated with selective cognitive deficits. Interpretation: The advanced group displayed evidence of increased atrophy across all neuroimaging features that was not found in either of the mixed groups. This is in line with biomarkers of preclinical AD and cerebrovascular disease. These findings suggest that the variation in structural and functional brain ageing across individuals reflects the degree of underlying neuropathological processes and may indicate the propensity to develop dementia in later life.

Methods: In this study, we included 428 ALS and 288 control samples collected between 2011 and 2021. We calculated EAA using the GrimAge residual method from ALS and control blood samples and grouped participants with ALS into three ageing groups (fast, normal, slow). We associated EAA with ALS case status and survival, stratified by sex, and correlated it with environmental and biological factors through occupational exposure assessments, immune cell proportions, and transcriptome changes. Findings: Participants with ALS had higher average EAA by 1.80 ± 0.30 years (p < 0.0001) versus controls. Participants with ALS in the fast ageing group had a hazard ratio of 1.52 (95% confidence interval 1.16–2.00, p = 0.0028) referenced to the normal ageing group. In males, this hazard ratio was 1.55 (95% confidence interval 1.11–2.17, p = 0.010), and EAA was positively correlated with high-risk occupational exposures including particulate matter (adj.p < 0.0001) and metals (adj.p = 0.0087). Also, in male participants with ALS, EAA was positively correlated with neutrophil proportions and was negatively correlated with CD4+ T cell proportions. Pathways dysregulated in participants with ALS with fast ageing included spliceosome, nucleocytoplasmic transport, axon guidance, and interferons. Interpretation: EAA was associated with ALS case status and, at least in males, with shorter survival after diagnosis. The effect of EAA on ALS was partially explained by occupational exposures and immune cell proportions in a sex-dependent manner.

Whether this is due to statistical handling of attrition (death and censoring) is unknown. METHODS: We quantified associations between cancer history and incident cognitive impairment among Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study participants without baseline cognitive impairment or stroke (n = 2604) using multiple competing-risks models and their corresponding estimands: cause-specific, subdistribution, and marginal hazards, plus composite-outcome (cognitive impairment or all-cause mortality) hazards. All-cause mortality was also modeled. RESULTS: After covariate adjustment (demographics, apolipoprotein E ε4, lifestyle, health conditions), cause-specific and marginal hazard ratios (HRs) were similar to each other (≈ 0.84; P values < 0.05). The subdistribution HR was 0.764 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.645–0.906), and composite-outcome Cox model HR was 1.149 (95% CI = 1.016–1.299). Cancer history was positively associated with all-cause mortality (HR = 1.813; 95% CI = 1.525–2.156).

This framework employed a variant allele fraction (VAF) threshold and harnessed multiple gene-based tests for robust identification and association testing of heteroplasmy. Our simulation studies demonstrated that gene-based tests maintained an appropriate type I error rate at α = 0.001. Notably, when 5 % or more heteroplasmic variants within a target region were linked to an outcome, burden-extension tests (including the adaptive burden test, variable threshold burden test, and z-score weighting burden test) outperformed the sequence kernel association test (SKAT) and the original burden test. Applying this framework, we conducted association analyses on whole-blood derived heteroplasmy in 17,507 individuals of African and European ancestries (31 % of African Ancestry, mean age of 62, with 58 % women) with whole genome sequencing data. We performed both cohort- and ancestry-specific association analyses, followed by meta-analysis on both pooled samples and within each ancestry group. Our results suggest that mtDNA-encoded genes/regions are likely to exhibit varying rates in somatic aging, with the notably strong associations observed between heteroplasmy in the RNR1 and RNR2 genes (p < 0.001) and advance aging by the Original Burden test. In contrast, SKAT identified significant associations (p < 0.001) between diabetes and the aggregated effects of heteroplasmy in several protein-coding genes.

Objective: We aimed to create a multi-ancestry genome-wide array that would include a wide range of neuro-specific genetic content to facilitate genetic research in neurological disorders across multiple ancestral groups, fostering diversity and inclusivity in research studies. Methods: We developed the Illumina NeuroBooster Array (NBA), a custom high-throughput and cost-effective platform on a backbone of 1,914,934 variants from the Infinium Global Diversity Array and added custom content comprising 95,273 variants associated with more than 70 neurological conditions or traits, and we further tested its performance on more than 2000 patient samples. This novel platform includes approximately 10,000 tagging variants to facilitate imputation and analyses of neurodegenerative disease–related genome-wide association study loci across diverse populations. Results: In this article, we describe NBA's potential as an efficient means for researchers to assess known and novel disease genetic associations in a multi-ancestry framework. The NBA can identify rare genetic variants and accurately impute more than 15 million common variants across populations. Apart from enabling sample prioritization for further whole-genome sequencing studies, we envisage that NBA will play a pivotal role in recruitment for interventional studies in the precision medicine space.

A genetic correlation analysis revealed significant common variant overlaps between RLS and neuroticism (rg = 0.40, se = 0.08, p value = 5.4 × 10−7), depression (rg = 0.35, se = 0.06, p value = 2.17 × 10−8), and intelligence (rg = −0.20, se = 0.06, p value = 4.0 × 10−4). Interpretation: Our study expands the understanding of the genetic architecture of RLS, and highlights the contributions of common variants to this prevalent neurological disorder.

To further understand the specific role of ketamine's metabolism in the AD actions of the drug, we evaluated the effects of inhibiting hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes on AD responses. We assessed whether pre-treatment with fluconazole (10 and 20 mg/kg, i. p.) 1 h prior to ketamine or HNKs (10 mg/kg, i. p.) administration would alter behavioral and neurochemical actions of the drugs in male BALB/cJ mice with a highly anxious phenotype.

Pre-treatment with fluconazole altered the pharmacokinetic profile of ketamine, by increasing both plasma and brain levels of ketamine and (R,S)-norketamine, while robustly reducing those of (6)-HNKs. At 24 h post-injection (t24 h), fluconazole prevented the sustained AD-like response of ketamine responses in the forced swim test and splash test, as well as the enhanced cortical GABA levels produced by ketamine. A single (2R,6R)-HNK administration resulted in prevention of the effects of fluconazole on the antidepressant-like activity of ketamine in mice.

Initially, transcriptomic data were analyzed to evaluate key genes related with distal tubules, CYB5R3, and NAD+ metabolism, showing significant differences between males and females in adult and old mice. Subsequently, our emphasis focused on assessing how these interventions, that have demonstrated the anti-aging potential, influenced structural parameters of distal tubule mitochondria, such as morphology and mass, as well as abundance, distance, and length of mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contact sites, employing an electron microscopy approach. Our findings indicate that both interventions have differential effects depending on the age and sex of the mice. Aging resulted in an increase in mitochondrial size and a decrease in mitochondrial abundance in males, while a reduction in abundance, size, and mitochondrial mass was observed in old females when compared with their adult counterparts. Combining both the interventions, CYB5R3 overexpression and dietary NR supplementation mitigated age-related changes; however, these effects were mainly accounted by NR in males and by transgenesis in females.

Both enantiomers have short plasma half-lives, and their pharmacokinetics might be improved through the use of either once or twice-daily administration of an extended-release dosage form. Phenserine was observed to form a colored degradation product in near-neutral and alkaline pH environments, and at pH 7, the half-life of posiphen was determined to be ~ 9 h (40 °C). To limit luminal degradation which would reduce bioavailability, a gastroretentive tablet composed of a polyethylene oxide-xanthan gum matrix was developed. When placed in simulated gastric fluid (pH 1.2), approximately 70% of the phenserine was released over a 12 h period, and no degradants were detected in the release medium. In comparison, a traditional hydrophilic-matrix, extended-release tablet showed measurable amounts of phenserine degradation in a pH 7.2 medium over an 8 h release interval. These results confirm that a gastroretentive tablet can reduce the luminal degradation of phenserine or posiphen by limiting exposure to neutral pH conditions while providing sustained release of the drug over at least 12 h. Additional advantages of the gastroretentive tablet include reduced gastric and intestinal concentrations of the drug resulting from the slower release from the gastroretentive tablet which may also limit the occurrence of the dose-limiting GI side effects previously observed with immediate-release phenserine capsules.

Previous evidence suggests a connection between LID and a disruption of the dopaminergic system as well as genes implicated in PD, including GBA1 and LRRK2. Objectives: Our goal was to investigate the effects of genetic variants on risk and time to LID. Methods: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and analyses focused on GBA1 and LRRK2 variants. We also calculated polygenic risk scores (PRS) including risk variants for PD and variants in genes involved in the dopaminergic transmission pathway. To test the influence of genetics on LID risk we used logistic regression, and to examine its impact on time to LID we performed Cox regression including 1612 PD patients with and 3175 without LID. Results: We found that GBA1 variants were associated with LID risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21–2.26; P = 0.0017) and LRRK2 variants with reduced time to LID onset (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.42; 95% CI, 1.09–1.84; P = 0.0098). The fourth quartile of the PD PRS was associated with increased LID risk (ORfourth_quartile = 1.27; 95% CI, 1.03–1.56; P = 0.0210). The third and fourth dopamine pathway PRS quartiles were associated with a reduced time to development of LID (HRthird_quartile = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.07–1.79; P = 0.0128; HRfourth_quartile = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.06–1.78; P = 0.0147). Conclusions: This study suggests that variants implicated in PD and in the dopaminergic transmission pathway play a role in the risk/time to develop LID.

Lifelong CR leads to increased expression and activity of plasma membrane CYB5R3, and male mice overexpressing CYB5R3 exhibit some beneficial adaptations that are also seen with CR. However, the mechanisms involved in both interventions could be independent since key aspects of energy metabolism and tissue lipid profile do not coincide, and many of the changes induced by CR in mitochondrial abundance and dynamics in the liver and skeletal muscle could be counteracted by CYB5R3 overexpression. In this study, we sought to elucidate the impact of CR on key markers of metabolic status, mitochondrial function, and pro-oxidant/antioxidant balance in transgenic (TG) female mice overexpressing CYB5R3 compared to their WT littermates. In females fed ad libitum, CYB5R3 overexpression decreased fat mass, led to a preferred utilization of fatty acids as an energy source, upregulated key antioxidant enzymes, and boosted respiration both in skeletal muscle and liver mitochondria, supporting that CYB5R3 overexpression is phenotypic closer to CR in females than in males. Whereas some markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics were found decreased in TG females on CR, as also found for the levels of Estrogen Receptor α, mitochondrial abundance and activity were maintained both in skeletal muscle and in liver.

After adjusting for relevant covariates, positive associations were observed between pTau181, NfL and GFAP and all MRI metrics. These associations reached significance (p<0.05) except for CP volume vs. pTau181 (p=0.14), CP volume vs. NfL (p=0.35), and T2 vs. NFL (p=0.07). Further, negative associations between Aß42/40 and all MRI metrics were observed but reached significance only for Aß42/40 vs. T2 (p=0.04). These novel findings demonstrate that reduced CP macrostructural and microstructural integrity is positively associated with blood-based biomarkers of AD pathology, neurodegeneration/ neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Degradation of the CP structure may co-occur with AD pathology and neuroinflammation ahead of clinically detectable cognitive impairment, making the CP a potential structure of interest for early disease detection or treatment monitoring.",13,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,16,16,21100349562,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,139,aging | Alzheimer’s disease | choroid plexus | neuroinflammation | quantitative MRI,NIA,National Institute on Aging,NA,NA

Pre-treatment with oral sitagliptin or PF-00734,200 reduced methamphetamine (meth)-induced rotation post-lesioning and dopaminergic degeneration in lesioned substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and striatum. Direct intracerebroventricular gliptin administration lacked neuroprotective actions, indicating that systemic incretin-mediated mechanisms underpin gliptin-induced favorable brain effects. Post-treatment with a threefold higher oral gliptin dose, likewise, mitigated meth-induced rotation, dopaminergic neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, and augmented neurogenesis.

We have previously demonstrated through bioinformatics that constitutive adenylyl cyclase activation in TGAC8 mice is associated with the activation of inflammation-related signaling pathways. However, the immune response associated with chronic myocardial stress in the TGAC8 mouse remains unexplored. Here we demonstrate that chronic activation of adenylyl cyclase in cardiomyocytes of TGAC8 mice results in activation of cell-autonomous RelA-mediated NF-κB signaling. This is associated with non-cell-autonomous activation of proinflammatory and age-associated signaling in myocardial endothelial cells and myocardial smooth muscle cells, expansion of myocardial immune cells, increase in serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, and changes in the size or composition of lymphoid organs. All these changes precede the appearance of cardiac fibrosis. We provide evidence indicating that RelA activation in cardiomyocytes with chronic activation of adenylyl cyclase is mediated by calcium-protein Kinase A (PKA) signaling. Using a model of chronic cardiomyocyte stress and accelerated aging, we highlight a novel, calcium/PKA/RelA-dependent connection between cardiomyocyte stress, myocardial inflammation, and systemic inflammation.

We propose a multi-method and multi-atlas methodology for automated segmentation of functional muscle groups in three-dimensional (3D) thigh magnetic resonance images. These groups lie anatomically adjacent to each other, rendering their manual delineation a challenging and time-consuming task. Approach: We introduce a framework for automated segmentation of the four main functional muscle groups of the thigh, gracilis, hamstring, quadriceps femoris, and sartorius, using chemical shift encoded water-fat magnetic resonance imaging (CSE-MRI). We propose fusing anatomical mappings from multiple deformable models with 3D deep learning model-based segmentation. This approach leverages the generalizability of multi-atlas segmentation (MAS) and accuracy of deep networks, hence enabling accurate assessment of volume and fat content of muscle groups. Results: For segmentation performance evaluation, we calculated the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff distance 95th percentile (HD-95). We evaluated the proposed framework, its variants, and baseline methods on 15 healthy subjects by threefold cross-validation and tested on four patients. Fusion of multiple atlases, deformable registration models, and deep learning segmentation produced the top performance with an average DSC of 0.859 and HD-95 of 8.34 over all muscles. Conclusions: Fusion of multiple anatomical mappings from multiple MAS techniques enriches the template set and improves the segmentation accuracy. Additional fusion with deep network decisions applied to the subject space offers complementary information.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether baseline depressive symptoms predict incident T2D in Icelandic older people and whether health and lifestyle characteristics of participants, can explain the relation between depression and diabetes. Methods. We used data from the Age-Gene/Environment-Suscepti-bility-Reykjavik-Study (65-96 years). From the original sample of 3316 participants who finished follow-up, 2823 non-diabetic participants with a complete dataset on depressive symptoms and incident T2D at endpoint were included in this analysis.

Previous published PACs were constructed either in smaller studies or mainly in white individuals, and they used proteomic measures from only one-time point. In this study, we created de novo PACs and compared their performance to published PACs at 2 different time points in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study of white and black participants (around 75% white and 25% black). Medthods and findings A total of 4,712 plasma proteins were measured using SomaScan in blood samples collected in 1990 to 1992 from 11,761 midlife participants (aged 46 to 70 years) and in 2011 to 2013 from 5,183 late-life participants (aged 66 to 90 years). The de novo ARIC PACs were constructed by training them against chronological age using elastic net regression in two-thirds of healthy participants in midlife and late life and validated in the remaining one-third of healthy participants at the corresponding time point. We also computed 3 published PACs. We estimated age acceleration for each PAC as residuals after regressing each PAC on chronological age. We also calculated the change in age acceleration from midlife to late life. We examined the associations of age acceleration and change in age acceleration with mortality through 2019 from all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and lower respiratory disease (LRD) using Cox proportional hazards regression in participants (irrespective of health) after excluding the training set. The model was adjusted for chronological age, smoking, body mass index (BMI), and other confounders. We externally validated the midlife PAC using the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Exam 1 data. The ARIC PACs had a slightly stronger correlation with chronological age than published PACs in healthy participants at each time point. Associations with mortality were similar for the ARIC PACs and published PACs. For late-life and midlife age acceleration for the ARIC PACs, respectively, hazard ratios (HRs) per 1 standard deviation were 1.65 and 1.38 (both p < 0.001) for all-cause mortality, 1.37 and 1.20 (both p < 0.001) for CVD mortality, 1.21 (p = 0.028) and 1.04 (p = 0.280) for cancer mortality, and 1.46 and 1.68 (both p < 0.001) for LRD mortality. For the change in age acceleration, HRs for all-cause, CVD, and LRD mortality were comparable to the HRs for late-life age acceleration. The association between the change in age acceleration and cancer mortality was not significant. The external validation of the midlife PAC in MESA showed significant associations with mortality, as observed for midlife participants in ARIC. The main limitation is that our PACs were constructed in midlife and late-life participants. It is unknown whether these PACs could be applied to young individuals. Conclusions In this longitudinal study, we found that the ARIC PACs and published PACs were similarly associated with an increased risk of mortality. These findings suggested that PACs show promise as biomarkers of biological age.

Mislocalization of overexpressed CENP-A to noncentromeric regions contributes to chromosomal instability in yeasts, flies, and humans. Overexpression and mislocalization of CENP-A observed in many cancers are associated with poor prognosis. Previous studies have shown that F-box proteins, Cdc4 and Met30 of the Skp, Cullin, F-box ubiquitin ligase cooperatively regulate proteolysis of Cse4 to prevent Cse4 mislocalization and chromosomal instability under normal physiological conditions. Mck1-mediated phosphorylation of Skp, Cullin, F-box-Cdc4 substrates such as Cdc6 and Rcn1 enhances the interaction of the substrates with Cdc4. Here, we report that Mck1 interacts with Cse4, and Mck1-mediated proteolysis of Cse4 prevents Cse4 mislocalization for chromosomal stability. Our results showed that mck1Δstrain overexpressing CSE4 (GAL-CSE4) exhibits lethality, defects in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of Cse4, mislocalization of Cse4, and reduced Cse4-Cdc4 interaction. Strain expressing GAL-cse4-3A with mutations in three potential Mck1 phosphorylation consensus sites (S10, S16, and T166) also exhibits growth defects, increased stability with mislocalization of Cse4-3A, chromosomal instability, and reduced interaction with Cdc4. Constitutive expression of histone H3 (Δ16H3) suppresses the chromosomal instability phenotype of GAL-cse4-3A strain, suggesting that the chromosomal instability phenotype is linked to Cse4-3A mislocalization. We conclude that Mck1 and its three potential phosphorylation sites on Cse4 promote Cse4-Cdc4 interaction and this contributes to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of Cse4 preventing its mislocalization and chromosomal instability.

Methods: Serum pepsinogen I was measured in 518 persons (mean age 51.6, SD 8.8; 49% women). A medical chart review focused on PPI prescriptions and gastroscopic findings in the follow-up period. Results: Patients with serological atrophic gastritis (pepsinogen I < 28 μg/L) had higher body mass index (27.5 vs 26.2 kg/m2; P = 0.007), were less likely to be current smokers (8% vs 17%; P = 0.025), and had higher prevalence of Helicobacter pylori seropositivity (57% vs 36%; P < 0.001) compared with those without.

We sought to quantify vascular risk factor risks over adulthood and assess the empirical evidence for risk thresholds.

However, functional beta cells can persist even in the face of continuous insulitis. Despite advances in immunosuppressive treatments, maintaining functional beta cells to prevent insulitis progression and hyperglycaemia remains a challenge. The cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R), present in immune cells and beta cells, regulates inflammation and beta cell function. Here, we pioneer an ex vivo model mirroring human insulitis to investigate the role of CB1R in this process. Methods: CD4+ T lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from male and female individuals at the onset of type 1 diabetes and from non-diabetic individuals, RNA was extracted and mRNA expression was analysed by real-time PCR. Single beta cell expression from donors with type 1 diabetes was obtained from data mining. Patient-derived human islets from male and female cadaveric donors were 3D-cultured in solubilised extracellular matrix gel in co-culture with the same donor PBMCs, and incubated with cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-γ) for 24–48 h in the presence of vehicle or increasing concentrations of the CB1R blocker JD-5037. Expression of CNR1 (encoding for CB1R) was ablated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Viability, intracellular stress and signalling were assayed by live-cell probing and real-time PCR. The islet function measured as glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was determined in a perifusion system. Infiltration of immune cells into the islets was monitored by microscopy. Non-obese diabetic mice aged 7 weeks were treated for 1 week with JD-5037, then euthanised. Profiling of immune cells infiltrated in the islets was performed by flow cytometry. Results: CNR1 expression was upregulated in circulating CD4+ T cells from individuals at type 1 diabetes onset (6.9-fold higher vs healthy individuals) and in sorted islet beta cells from donors with type 1 diabetes (3.6-fold higher vs healthy counterparts). The peripherally restricted CB1R inverse agonist JD-5037 arrested the initiation of insulitis in humans and mice. Mechanistically, CB1R blockade prevented islet NO production and ameliorated the ATF6 arm of the unfolded protein response. Consequently, cyto/chemokine expression decreased in human islets, leading to sustained islet cell viability and function. Conclusions/interpretation: These results suggest that CB1R could be an interesting target for type 1 diabetes while highlighting the regulatory mechanisms of insulitis. Moreover, these findings may apply to type 2 diabetes where islet inflammation is also a pathophysiological factor.

The effects of specific vestibular end-organ deficits and hearing impairments on spatial navigation have received little to no attention. We hypothesized that hearing impairment adversely affects spatial navigation and that bimodal impairments (vestibular and hearing) further impair navigation ability. Methods: Data from 182 participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging who had interpretable results for the video head impulse test (vHIT), cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP) and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (oVEMP), audiometric testing, and the triangle completion test (TCT) were retrospectively analyzed. Multiple linear regression, controlling for age, sex, and cognition, was employed to identify predictors of TCT performance in terms of endpoint error, angle deviation, and distance walked. Results: oVEMP abnormalities were associated with larger end-point error (p = 0.008) and larger angle deviation (p = 0.002) but were not associated with distance walked (p = 0.392). Abnormalities on cVEMP testing and vHIT were not associated with distance walked (p = 0.835, p = 0.300), end-point error (p = 0.256, p = 0.808), or angle deviation (p = 0.192, p = 0.966). Compared with normalhearing adults, hearing-impaired adults walked a shorter distance during the TCT (p = 0.049) but had a similar endpoint error (p = 0.302) and angle deviation (p = 0.466). There was no interaction between vestibular and hearing function for predicting spatial navigation ability. Conclusion: In this cohort analysis, utricular dysfunction and hearing impairment were associated with poorer spatial navigation performance. We postulate that hearing impairment negatively affects one's ability to use real-Time, intrinsic auditory cues and/or prior experience to guide navigation.",1,38493767,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,13625,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,170,Hearing impairment | Perception | Peripheral vestibular loss | Triangle completion test | Utricle,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study utilized post-mortem brain tissue from rhesus monkeys that died after decades on a 30 % reduced calorie diet. We found that CR subjects had significantly fewer cells with oxidative damage within the corpus callosum and the cingulum bundle. Oligodendrocytes specifically showed the greatest response to CR with a robust reduction in DNA damage. Additionally, we observed alterations in microglia morphology with CR subjects having a higher proportion of ramified, homeostatic microglia and fewer pro-inflammatory, hypertrophic microglia relative to controls. Furthermore, we determined that the observed attenuation in damaged DNA occurs primarily within mitochondria.

Since direct measurement of VO2max is infeasible in large epidemiologic cohort studies, we sought to develop, validate, compare, and assess the transportability of several ML VO2max prediction algorithms. Methods: The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) participants with valid VO2max tests were included (n = 1080). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, linear- and tree-boosted extreme gradient boosting, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms were trained to predict VO2max values. We developed these algorithms for: (a) the overall BLSA, (b) by sex, (c) using all BLSA variables, and (d) variables common in aging cohorts. Finally, we quantified the associations between measured and predicted VO2max and mortality. Results: The age was 69.0 ± 10.4 years (mean ± SD) and the measured VO2max was 21.6 ± 5.9 mL/kg/min. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, linear- and tree-boosted extreme gradient boosting, random forest, and support vector machine yielded root mean squared errors of 3.4 mL/kg/min, 3.6 mL/kg/min, 3.4 mL/kg/min, 3.6 mL/kg/min, and 3.5 mL/kg/min, respectively. Incremental quartiles of measured VO2max showed an inverse gradient in mortality risk. Predicted VO2max variables yielded similar effect estimates but were not robust to adjustment. Conclusion: Measured VO2max is a strong predictor of mortality. Using ML can improve the accuracy of prediction as compared to simpler approaches but estimates of association with mortality remain sensitive to adjustment. Future studies should seek to reproduce these results so that VO2max, an important vital sign, can be more broadly studied as a modifiable target for promoting functional resiliency and healthy aging.",0,38428731,Journal,ar,Article,100,8,8,21100294621,K01 CA234317,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,174,Cardiorespiratory fitness | Epidemiology | Mortality | Prediction algorithms,SDSU,San Diego State University,NA,S2095254624000218

Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation play a key role in inducing demyelinating diseases like MS; hence, controlling oxidative stress and neuroinflammation is important. Cuprizone (CPZ), a copper chelator, generates oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, thereby inducing demyelination. Therefore, the CPZ-induced demyelinating mouse model (CPZ model) is widely used in research. The present study was intended to unravel a mechanism of inhibition of demyelination by arsenic in a CPZ model, which is otherwise known for its toxicity. We investigated an alternative mechanism of inhibition of demyelination by arsenic through the reversal of SOD1 activity employing in silico analysis, analytical chemistry techniques, and in vitro and in vivo experiments. In vivo experiments showed protection of body weight, survivability, and myelination of the corpus callosum in CPZ and arsenic-co-exposed animals, where neuroinflammation was apparently not involved. In vitro experiments revealed that arsenic-mediated reversal of impaired SOD1 activity leads to reduced cellular ROS levels and better viability of primary oligodendrocytes. Reversal of SOD1 activity was also observed in the corpus callosum tissue isolated from experimental animals. In silico and analytical chemistry studies revealed that similar to copper, arsenic can potentially bind to CPZ and thereby make the copper freely available for SOD1 activity. Suitable neurobehavior tests further validated the protective effect of arsenic. Taken together, the present study revealed that arsenic protects oligodendrocytes and demyelination of corpus callosum by reversing CPZ-induced impaired SOD1 activity.",1,38353925,Journal,ar,Article,100,9,9,14160,EMR/2017/001941,0,FALSE,NA,NA,176,Arsenic | Corpus callosum | Cuprizone | Demyelination | Microglia | Neuroinflammation | SOD1,SERB,Science and Engineering Research Board,NA,NA

It has been suggested that cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) may preserve and enhance cerebral myelination throughout the adult lifespan, but this hypothesis has not been fully tested. Among cognitively normal participants from two well-characterized studies spanning a wide age range, we assessed CRF operationalized as the maximum rate of oxygen consumption (VO2max) and myelin content defined by myelin water fraction (MWF) estimated through our advanced multicomponent relaxometry MRI method. We found significant positive correlations between VO2max and MWF across several white matter regions. Interestingly, the effect size of this association was higher in brain regions susceptible to early degeneration, including the frontal lobes and major white matter fiber tracts. Further, the interaction between age and VO2max exhibited i) a steeper positive slope in the older age group, suggesting that the association of VO2max with MWF is stronger at middle and older ages and ii) a steeper negative slope in the lower VO2max group, indicating that lower VO2max levels are associated with lower myelination with increasing age. Finally, the nonlinear pattern of myelin maturation and decline is VO2max-dependent with the higher VO2max group reaching the MWF peak at later ages.

The relative contributions of the specific V_ O2 components driving this decline, namely cardiac output (CO) and arteriovenous oxygen difference (A – V)O2, remain unclear. We examined this issue by analyzing data from 99 community-dwelling participants (baseline age: 21–96 yr old; average follow-up: 12.6 yr old) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, free of clinical cardiovascular disease. V_ O2peak, a surrogate of V_ O2max, was used to assess aerobic capacity during upright cycle ergometry. Peak exercise left ventricular volumes, heart rate, and CO were estimated using repeated gated cardiac blood pool scans. The Fick equation was used to calculate (A – V)O2diff,peak from COpeak and V_ O2peak. In unadjusted models, V_ O2peak, (A – V)O2diff,peak, and COpeak declined longitudinally over time at steady rates with advancing age. In multiple linear regression models adjusting for baseline values and peak workload, however, steeper declines in V_ O2peak and (A – V)O2diff,peak were observed with advanced entry age but not in COpeak. The association between the declines in V_ O2peak and (A – V)O2diff,peak was stronger among those ≥50 yr old compared with their younger counterparts, but the difference between the two age groups did not reach statistical significance. These findings suggest that age-associated impairment of peripheral oxygen utilization during maximal exercise poses a stronger limitation on peak V_ O2 than that of CO.

As a result, genetic information is not incorporated into clinical care, and variant-targeted precision medicine trials struggle to enrol people with Parkinson’s disease. Understanding the yield of genetic testing using an established gene panel in a large, geographically diverse North American population would help patients, clinicians, clinical researchers, laboratories and insurers better understand the importance of genetics in approaching Parkinson’s disease. PD GENEration is an ongoing multi-centre, observational study (NCT04057794, NCT04994015) offering genetic testing with results disclosure and genetic counselling to those in the US (including Puerto Rico), Canada and the Dominican Republic, through local clinical sites or remotely through self-enrolment. DNA samples are analysed by next-generation sequencing including deletion/duplication analysis (Fulgent Genetics) with targeted testing of seven major Parkinson’s disease-related genes. Variants classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic/risk variants are disclosed to all tested participants by either neurologists or genetic counsellors. Demographic and clinical features are collected at baseline visits. Between September 2019 and June 2023, the study enrolled 10 510 participants across >85 centres, with 8301 having received results.

Methods: We compared associations of relative and absolute intensity PA with incident major cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in 5 633 women from the Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health Study (mean age 78.5 ± 6.7). Absolute intensity was measured by accelerometry. Relative intensity was estimated by dividing accelerometer-estimated metabolic equivalents (METs) by maximal MET capacity. Both were aggregated into mean daily hours of light intensity PA (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). Cox proportional hazard models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for 1-hour higher amounts of PA on outcomes. Results: During follow-up (median = 7.4 years), there were 748 incident CVD events and 1 312 deaths. Greater LPA and MVPA, on either scale, were associated with reduced risk of both outcomes. HRs for a 1-hour increment of absolute LPA were 0.88 (95% CI: 0.83–0.93) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.84–0.92) for incident CVD and mortality, respectively.

We examine the pathogenicity of a novel VUS P93S in Annexin A11 (ANXA11) – an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia-associated gene – in a corticobasal syndrome kindred. Established ANXA11 mutations cause ANXA11 aggregation, altered lysosomal-RNA granule co-trafficking, and transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) mis-localization. METHODS: We described the clinical presentation and explored the phenotypic diversity of ANXA11 variants. P93S's effect on ANXA11 function and TDP-43 biology was characterized in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons alongside multiomic neuronal and microglial profiling. RESULTS: ANXA11 mutations were linked to corticobasal syndrome cases. P93S led to decreased lysosome colocalization, neuritic RNA, and nuclear TDP-43 with cryptic exon expression. Multiomic microglial signatures implicated immune dysregulation and interferon signaling pathways. DISCUSSION: This study establishes ANXA11 P93S pathogenicity, broadens the phenotypic spectrum of ANXA11 mutations, underscores neuronal and microglial dysfunction in ANXA11 pathophysiology, and demonstrates the potential of cellular models to determine variant pathogenicity. Highlights: ANXA11 P93S is a pathogenic variant. Corticobasal syndrome is part of the ANXA11 phenotypic spectrum. Hybridization chain reaction fluorescence in situ hybridization (HCR FISH) is a new tool for the detection of cryptic exons due to TDP-43-related loss of splicing regulation.

SDoH measures included race, the national-rank area deprivation index, education, and income. We examined associations of late-life gait speed with midlife hsCRP (V2 continuous and clinically high ≥3 mg/L), with 20-year hsCRP history from midlife (V2–V5 average continuous hsCRP and clinically high ≥3 mg/L) and with inflammation accumulation (visits and years with high hsCRP).

METHODS: A validated α-synuclein Seed Amplification Assay (SAA) was used on recent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 1638 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants, 78 with LB-pathology confirmation at autopsy. We compared SAA outcomes with neuropathology, Aβ and tau biomarkers, risk-factors, genetics, and cognitive trajectories. RESULTS: SAA showed 79% sensitivity and 97% specificity for LB pathology, with superior performance in identifying neocortical (100%) compared to limbic (57%) and amygdala-predominant (60%) LB-pathology. SAA+ rate was 22%, increasing with disease stage and age. Higher Aβ burden but lower CSF p-tau181 associated with higher SAA+ rates, especially in dementia. SAA+ affected cognitive impairment in MCI and Early-AD who were already AD biomarker positive. DISCUSSION: SAA is a sensitive, specific marker for LB-pathology. Its increase in prevalence with age and AD stages, and its association with AD biomarkers, highlights the clinical importance of α-synuclein co-pathology in understanding AD's nature and progression. Highlights: SAA shows 79% sensitivity, 97% specificity for LB-pathology detection in AD. SAA positivity prevalence increases with disease stage and age. Higher Aβ burden, lower CSF p-tau181 linked with higher SAA+ rates in dementia. SAA+ impacts cognitive impairment in early disease stages.

Objective: To investigate the correlation between leg muscle strength and balance during gait concerning functional performance in healthy older adults. Methods: Participants included 117 adults aged 60-95 years were recruited from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). They underwent evaluations of gait, balance, and maximum isometric leg torque (for both hamstrings and quadriceps). Analyses examined the association between leg torque and functional performance among those with higher and lower balances. Results: Individuals with lower balance (n = 43) were older, more prone to experiencing a fear of falling, and exhibited lower functional performance (gait speeds and Generalized Gait Stability Scores (GGSS), ps < 0.001) compared to their counterparts with higher balance (n = 74). At a usual walking pace, the GGSS showed a positive association with concentric Quadriceps Maximum Torque (QMT) in participants with lower balance (p = 0.013). Conversely, it displayed a positive association with eccentric QMT in those with higher balance (p = 0.014). At a fast walking pace, only individuals with higher balance demonstrated a positive muscle torque association with both gait speed and GGSS, encompassing concentric and eccentric actions in both the quadriceps and hamstrings (ps < 0.050). Conclusion: Evaluating muscle strength capacity in both concentric and eccentric phases during dynamic high-effort events, along with investigating their associations with gait performance, can be beneficial for identifying subtle gait deficits.

In the current work, we analyzed 4,685 sFTD cases and 15,308 controls looking for common genetic determinants for sFTD. We found a cluster of variants at the MAPT (rs199443; p = 2.5 × 10−12, OR = 1.27) and APOE (rs6857; p = 1.31 × 10−12, OR = 1.27) loci and a candidate locus on chromosome 3 (rs1009966; p = 2.41 × 10−8, OR = 1.16) in the intergenic region between RPSA and MOBP, contributing to increased risk for sFTD through effects on expression and/or splicing in brain cortex of functionally relevant in-cis genes at the MAPT and RPSA-MOBP loci.

We also examined whether the BMI-PD relation is bidirectional by performing a reverse MR.MethodsWe used summary statistics from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to extract the association of 501 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with BMI and from the Courage-PD and international Parkinson Disease Genomics Consortium (iPDGC) to estimate their association with PD. Analyses are based on participants of European ancestry. We used the inverse-weighted method to compute odds ratios (ORIVW per 4.8 kg/m2 [95% CI]) of PD and additional pleiotropy robust methods. We performed analyses stratified by age, disease duration, and sex. For reverse MR, we used SNPs associated with PD from 2 iPDGC GWAS to assess the effect of genetic liability toward PD on BMI.ResultsSummary statistics for BMI are based on 806,834 participants (54% women).

Exposures: Protein aptamers, measured at study V3 and V5. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes assessed included incident HF hospitalization after V3 and after V5, prevalent frailty at V5, and incident frailty between V5 and visit 6 (V6; 2016-2017; n = 4131). Frailty was assessed using the Fried criteria.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) exhibits spatially varying and correlated noise, so care must be taken with distributional assumptions. Here, we characterize the role of physiology, subject compliance, and the interaction of the subject with the scanner in the understanding of DTI variability, as modeled in the spatial variance of derived metrics in homogeneous regions. Approach: We analyze DTI data from 1035 subjects in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, with ages ranging from 22.4 to 103 years old. For each subject, up to 12 longitudinal sessions were conducted. We assess the variance of DTI scalars within regions of interest (ROIs) defined by four segmentation methods and investigate the relationships between the variance and covariates, including baseline age, time from the baseline (referred to as ""interval""), motion, sex, and whether it is the first scan or the second scan in the session. Results: Covariate effects are heterogeneous and bilaterally symmetric across ROIs. Inter-session interval is positively related (p ≫ 0.001)to FA variance in the cuneus and occipital gyrus, but negatively (p ≫ 0.001) in the caudate nucleus. Males show significantly (p ≫ 0.001) higher FA variance in the right putamen, thalamus, body of the corpus callosum, and cingulate gyrus. In 62 out of 176 ROIs defined by the Eve type-1 atlas, an increase in motion is associated (p < 0.05) with a decrease in FA variance. Head motion increases during the rescan of DTI (Δμ = 0.045 mm per volume). Conclusions: The effects of each covariate on DTI variance and their relationships across ROIs are complex.

Given the limited focus on females in previous studies, this research aimed to evaluate the effects of dietary curcumin on obesity and NAFLD outcomes in naturally aged (18-month-old) female mice. Methods: Female C57BL/6 mice aged 18 months were fed a normal chow diet (NCD) and a HFHSD, with or without curcumin (0.4% w/w), for an 8-week period. Parameters included food intake, body weight, insulin tolerance test (ITT), glucose tolerance test (GTT), percentage fat mass, hepatic triglyceride, and cholesterol levels, and a histological examination for NAFLD detection, qPCR, and immunoblotting analyses were performed. Results: The cumulative body weight gain after 8 weeks in the aged female mice supplemented with curcumin and fed an HFHSD was significantly lower (10.84 ± 1.09 g) compared to those fed a HFHSD alone (15.28 ± 1.26 g). Curcumin supplementation also resulted in reduced total body fat (HFHSD group 50.83 ± 1.71% vs. HFHSD+CUR 41.46 ± 3.21%), decreased epidydimal fat mass (HFHSD: 3.79 ± 0.29 g vs. HFHSD+CUR: 2.66 ± 0.30 g), and repaired adipogenic signaling in the white adipose tissue.

We used a neuropsychological test battery to assess cognitive function. Data were analyzed using general linear models. Results: Greater BG-EPVS load was associated with lower z-scores in memory, verbal fluency, and global cognition (p < 0.05); these associations became non-significant when controlling for other cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) markers (e.g., WMHs, lacunes, and mixed CMBs). Overall, CSO-EPVS load was not associated with cognitive z-scores (p > 0.05); among apolipoprotein E (APOE) -ε4 carriers, greater CSO-EPVS load was associated with lower verbal fluency z-score, even when controlling for other CSVD markers (p < 0.05).

Normal brain function relies on energy transformation by mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Two main lines of evidence position mitochondria both as targets and drivers of psychosocial experiences. On the one hand, chronic stress exposure and mood states may alter multiple aspects of mitochondrial biology; on the other hand, functional variations in mitochondrial OxPhos capacity may alter social behavior, stress reactivity, and mood. But are psychosocial exposures and subjective experiences linked to mitochondrial biology in the human brain? By combining longitudinal antemortem assessments of psychosocial factors with postmortem brain (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) proteomics in older adults, we find that higher well-being is linked to greater abundance of the mitochondrial OxPhos machinery, whereas higher negative mood is linked to lower OxPhos protein content. Combined, positive and negative psychosocial factors explained 18 to 25% of the variance in the abundance of OxPhos complex I, the primary biochemical entry point that energizes brain mitochondria. Moreover, interrogating mitochondrial psychobiological associations in specific neuronal and nonneuronal brain cells with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed strong cell-type- specific associations for positive psychosocial experiences and mitochondria in glia but opposite associations in neurons.

RESULTS: Among 5296 initially dementia-free participants (mean [standard deviation] age of 75.8 [5.1] years; 60.1% women, 22.2% Black) over a median follow-up of 7.9 years, the covariate-adjusted hazard ratio varied substantially depending on the pattern of domain-specific performance and age, in an orderly manner from single domain language abnormalities (lowest risk) to single domain executive or memory abnormalities, to multidomain abnormalities including memory (highest risk). DISCUSSION: By identifying normatively defined cognitive abnormalities by domains based on neuropsychological test performance, there is a conceptually orderly and age-sensitive spectrum of risk for incident dementia that provides valuable information about the likelihood of progression.

Methods: The present study involved 28,974 UK Biobank participants aged 50-74y at baseline (2006–2010) who were followed-up for ≤ 15 y for incidence of dementia. CVH was calculated using Life's Essential 8 (LE8) total scores. The scores were standardized and reverse coded to reflect poor CVH (LE8z_rev). OLINK proteomics was available on this sample (k = 1,463 plasma proteins). The study primarily tested the mediating effects of the plasma proteome in LE8z_rev-dementia effect. The total effect was decomposed into “mediation only” or pure indirect effect (PIE), “interaction only” or interaction referent (INTREF), “neither mediation nor interaction” or controlled direct effect (CDE), and “both mediation and interaction” or mediated interaction (INTMED). Results: The study found poorer CVH assessed by LE8z_rev increased the risk of all-cause dementia by 11 % [per 1 SD, hazard ratio, (HR) = 1.11, 95 % CI: 1.03–1.20, p = 0.005).

Methods: We analysed 39,533 UK Biobank participants of European genetic ancestry with brain MRI data. We studied brain iron estimated by R2* and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) in 8 subcortical regions: accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen, substantia nigra, and thalamus. We performed genome-wide associations studies (GWAS) and used Mendelian Randomization (MR) methods to estimate the causal effect of brain iron on grey matter volume, and risk of AD, non-AD and PD. We also used MR to test whether genetic liability to AD or PD causally increased brain iron (R2* and QSM). Findings: In GWAS of R2* and QSM we replicated 83% of previously reported genetic loci and identified 174 further loci across all eight brain regions.

Both macro- and microstructural GM characteristics were strongly associated with age, with widespread significant microstructural correlations reflective of cellular morphological changes, reduced cellular density, increased extracellular volume, and increased membrane permeability. Importantly, when correlating MRI and cognitive test scores, our findings revealed no link between macrostructural volumetric changes and neurobehavioral performance. However, we found that cellular and extracellular alterations in cortical and subcortical GM regions were associated with neurobehavioral performance. Based on these findings, it is hypothesized that increased microstructural heterogeneity and decreased neurite orientation dispersion precede macrostructural changes, and that they play an important role in subsequent cognitive decline. These alterations are suggested to be early markers of neurocognitive performance that may distinctly aid in identifying the mechanisms underlying phenotypic aging and subsequent age-related functional decline.",3,38659245,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,18391,K01EB032989,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,220,aging | diffusion | gray matter | microstructure | MRI | neurocognitive aging,NIA,National Institute on Aging,e14166,NA

We aimed to investigate the association between family history of gastric cancer and gastric cancer risk overall and by various subtypes in Asians in a prospective study. Methods: We included 12 prospective cohorts with 550,508 participants in the Asia Cohort Consortium. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate study-specific adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between family history of gastric cancer and gastric cancer incidence and mortality, then pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. Stratified analyses were performed for the anatomical subsites and histological subtypes. Results: During the mean follow-up of 15.6 years, 2258 incident gastric cancers and 5194 gastric cancer deaths occurred. The risk of incident gastric cancer was higher in individuals with a family history of gastric cancer (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.32–1.58), similarly in males (1.44, 1.31–1.59) and females (1.45, 1.23–1.70).

Long-read sequencing and subsequent comparative sequence analysis revealed that each full-length unit comprises an intergenic spacer (IGS) and a ∼13.4 kb long transcribed region encoding the three rRNAs, but with substantial variability in rDNA unit size, ranging from ∼35 to ∼46 kb. Within the transcribed regions of rDNA units, we found 209 variants, 70 of which are in external transcribed spacers (ETSs); but the rDNA size differences are driven primarily by IGS size heterogeneity, due to indels containing repetitive elements and some functional signals such as enhancers. Further evolutionary analysis categorized rDNA units into distinct clusters with characteristic IGS lengths; numbers of enhancers; and presence/absence of two common SNPs in promoter regions, one of which is located within promoter (p)RNA and may influence pRNA folding stability.

This process involves age-induced arterial proinflammation, collagen deposition, and calcification, which collectively contribute to arterial stiffening. The primary driver of proinflammatory processes leading to collagen deposition in the arterial wall is the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) signaling. Activation of this signaling is pivotal in driving vascular extracellular remodeling, eventually leading to arterial fibrosis and calcification. Interestingly, the glycosylated protein vasorin (VASN) physically interacts with TGF-β1, and functionally restraining its proinflammatory fibrotic signaling in arterial walls and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Notably, as age advances, matrix metalloproteinase type II (MMP-2) is activated, which effectively cleaves VASN protein in both arterial walls and VSMCs. This age-associated/MMP-2-mediated decrease in VASN levels exacerbates TGF-β1 activation, amplifying arterial fibrosis and calcification in the arterial wall. Importantly, TGF-β1 is a downstream molecule of the angiotensin II (Ang II) signaling pathway in the arterial wall and VSMCs, which is modulated by VASN. Indeed, chronic administration of Ang II to young rats significantly activates MMP-2 and diminishes the VASN expression to levels comparable to untreated older control rats. This review highlights and discusses the role played by VASN in mitigating fibrosis and calcification by alleviating TGF-β1 activation and signaling in arterial walls and VSMCs.

The immune system is at the forefront of these resilience mechanisms. Indeed, aging is associated with persistent activation of the immune system, witnessed by a high circulating level of inflammatory markers and activation of immune cells in the circulation and in tissue, a condition called “inflammaging.” Like aging, inflammaging is associated with increased risk of many age-related pathologies and disabilities, as well as frailty and death. Herein we discuss recent advances in the understanding of the mechanisms leading to inflammaging and the intrinsic dysregulation of the immune function that occurs with aging. We focus on the underlying mechanisms of chronic inflammation, in particular the role of NF-κB and recent studies targeting proinflammatory mediators. We further explore the dysregulation of the immune response with age and immunosenescence as an important mechanistic immune response to acute stressors. We examine the role of the gastrointestinal microbiome, age-related dysbiosis, and the integrated stress response in modulating the inflammatory “response” to damage accumulation and stress. We conclude by focusing on the seminal question of whether reducing inflammation is useful and the results of related clinical trials. In summary, we propose that inflammation may be viewed both as a clinical biomarker of the failure of resilience mechanisms and as a causal factor in the rising burden of disease and disabilities with aging.

In a cohort of around 22,000 individuals in the UK Biobank, a proteomic CRF score was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (unadjusted hazard ratio 0.50 (95% confidence interval 0.48–0.52) per 1 s.d. increase). The proteomic CRF score was also associated with multisystem disease risk and provided risk reclassification and discrimination beyond clinical risk factors, as well as modulating high polygenic risk of certain diseases. Finally, we observed dynamicity of the proteomic CRF score in individuals who undertook a 20-week exercise training program and an association of the score with the degree of the effect of training on CRF, suggesting potential use of the score for personalization of exercise recommendations.

This shift from a focus on solely treating existing disease to slowing the aging process is a shift toward prevention, including a focus on risk factors found in the social environment. Although geroscience traditionally has focused on the molecular and cellular drivers of biological aging, more fundamental causes of aging may be found in the social exposome - the complex array of human social environmental exposures that shape health and disease. The social exposome may interact with physiological processes to accelerate aging biology. In this commentary, we review the potential of these insights to shape the emerging field of translational geroscience. The articles in this special issue highlight how social stress and social determinants of health are associated with biomarkers of aging such as inflammation, epigenetic clocks, and telomeres, and spotlight promising interventions to mitigate stress-related inflammation. For geroscience to incorporate the social exposome into its translational agenda, studies are needed that elucidate and quantify the effects of social exposures on aging and that consider social exposures as intervention targets. The life course perspective allows us to measure both exposures and aging biology over time including sensitive periods of development and major social transitions. In addition, given rapid changes in the measurement of aging biology, which include machine learning techniques, multisystem phenotypes of aging are being developed to better reflect whole body aging, replacing reliance on single system biomarkers. In this expanded and more integrated field of translational geroscience, strategies targeting factors in the social exposome hold promise for achieving aging health equity and extending healthy longevity.",5,38718171,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,19172,R13AG067667,0,FALSE,NA,NA,235,Abbreviations | CMV = cytomegalovirus | geroscience | health disparities | healthy aging | life course | MBSR = mindfulness-based stress reduction | MIDUS = Midlife in the United States | NIA = National Institute on Aging | social exposome | social stress | translational geroscience,NIA,National Institute on Aging,NA,NA

The disease follows a continuum, starting with preclinical stages, progressing to mild cognitive and behavioral impairment, ultimately leading to dementia. Early detection of AD is crucial for better diagnosis and more effective treatment. However, the current AD diagnostic tests of biomarkers using cerebrospinal fluid and/or brain imaging are invasive or expensive, and mostly are still not able to detect early disease state. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop new diagnostic techniques with higher sensitivity and specificity during the preclinical stages of AD. Various non-cognitive manifestations, including behavioral abnormalities, sleep disturbances, sensory dysfunctions, and physical changes, have been observed in the preclinical AD stage before occurrence of notable cognitive decline. Recent research advances have identified several biofluid biomarkers as early indicators of AD.

In this study, we detected the upregulation of the SASP-related protein dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP4) in human primary lung cells rendered senescent by exposure to ionizing radiation. DPP4 is an exopeptidase that plays a crucial role in the cleavage of various proteins, resulting in the loss of N-terminal dipeptides and proinflammatory effects. Interestingly, our data revealed an association between severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and DDP4, namely that DPP4 levels increased in the plasma of patients with COVID-19 and were correlated with age and disease progression. Although we could not determine the direct effect of DDP4 on viral replication, mechanistic studies in cell culture revealed a negative impact on the expression of the tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), which contributes to epithelial barrier function. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated that DPP4 overexpressing cells exhibited a decrease in ZO-1 and increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. By investigating the effect of DPP4 on the barrier function of human primary cells, we detected an increase in ZO-1 using DPP4 inhibitors.

These results extend previous research from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and recent studies from SOMMA showing the importance of mitochondrial energetics in mobility. Together, these findings are painting a picture of how fundamental cellular processes influence the loss of mobility with aging. They may also be a window on aging in other cells, tissues, and systems.

The association of TDP-43 proteinopathy with AD neuropathologic changes (ADNC) and its impact on specific cognitive domains are not fully understood and whether loss of TDP-43 function occurs early in the aging brain remains unknown. Here, using a large set of autopsies from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and another younger cohort, we were able to study brains from subjects 21–109 years of age. Examination of these brains show that loss of TDP-43 splicing repression, as judged by TDP-43 nuclear clearance and expression of a cryptic exon in HDGFL2, first occurs during the 6th decade, preceding by a decade the appearance of TDP-43+ neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCIs). We corroborated this observation using a monoclonal antibody to demonstrate a cryptic exon-encoded neoepitope within HDGFL2 in neurons exhibiting nuclear clearance of TDP-43. TDP-43 nuclear clearance is associated with increased burden of tau pathology. Age at death, female sex, high CERAD neuritic plaque score, and high Braak neurofibrillary stage significantly increase the odds of LATE-NC. Faster rates of cognitive decline on verbal memory (California Verbal Learning Test immediate recall), visuospatial ability (Card Rotations Test), mental status (MMSE) and semantic fluency (Category Fluency Test) were associated with LATE-NC. Notably, the effects of LATE-NC on verbal memory and visuospatial ability are independent of ADNC. However, the effects of TDP-43 nuclear clearance in absence of NCI on the longitudinal trajectories and levels of cognitive measures are not significant. These results establish that loss of TDP-43 splicing repression is an early event occurring in the aging population during the development of TDP-43 proteinopathy and is associated with increased tau pathology.

Objective: To investigate the causal association between white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden, clinical stroke, blood pressure (BP), and dementia risk, while accounting for potential epidemiologic biases. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study first examined the association of genetically determined WMH burden, stroke, and BP levels with Alzheimer disease (AD) in a 2-sample mendelian randomization (2SMR) framework. Second, using population-based studies (1979-2018) with prospective dementia surveillance, the genetic association of WMH, stroke, and BP with incident all-cause dementia was examined. Data analysis was performed from July 26, 2020, through July 24, 2022. Exposures: Genetically determined WMH burden and BP levels, as well as genetic liability to stroke derived from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in European ancestry populations. Main Outcomes and Measures: The association of genetic instruments for WMH, stroke, and BP with dementia was studied using GWASs of AD (defined clinically and additionally meta-analyzed including both clinically diagnosed AD and AD defined based on parental history [AD-meta]) for 2SMR and incident all-cause dementia for longitudinal analyses. Results: In 2SMR (summary statistics-based) analyses using AD GWASs with up to 75024 AD cases (mean [SD] age at AD onset, 75.5 [4.4] years; 56.9% women), larger WMH burden showed evidence for a causal association with increased risk of AD (odds ratio [OR], 1.43; 95% CI, 1.10-1.86; P =.007, per unit increase in WMH risk alleles) and AD-meta (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.06-1.34; P =.008), after accounting for pulse pressure for the former. Blood pressure traits showed evidence for a protective association with AD, with evidence for confounding by shared genetic instruments. In the longitudinal (individual-level data) analyses involving 10699 incident all-cause dementia cases (mean [SD] age at dementia diagnosis, 74.4 [9.1] years; 55.4% women), no significant association was observed between larger WMH burden and incident all-cause dementia (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.04; P =.07). Although all exposures were associated with mortality, with the strongest association observed for systolic BP (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03-1.06; P = 1.9 × 10-14), there was no evidence for selective survival bias during follow-up using illness-death models. In secondary analyses using polygenic scores, the association of genetic liability to stroke, but not genetically determined WMH, with dementia outcomes was attenuated after adjusting for interim stroke. Conclusions: These findings suggest that WMH is a primary vascular factor associated with dementia risk, emphasizing its significance in preventive strategies for dementia.

Comparing top versus bottom deciles of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) reveals clinically meaningful differences in BP (16.9 mmHg systolic BP, 95% CI, 15.5–18.2 mmHg, P = 2.22 × 10−126) and more than a sevenfold higher odds of hypertension risk (odds ratio, 7.33; 95% CI, 5.54–9.70; P = 4.13 × 10−44) in an independent dataset. Adding PRS into hypertension-prediction models increased the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) from 0.791 (95% CI, 0.781–0.801) to 0.826 (95% CI, 0.817–0.836, ∆AUROC, 0.035, P = 1.98 × 10−34). We compare the 2,103 loci results in non-European ancestries and show significant PRS associations in a large African-American sample.

Among many tools developed so far, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) stands out as one of the pioneering and most widely used methods. Although originally developed for microarray data, GSEA is nowadays extensively utilized for RNA-seq data analysis. Here, we quantitatively assessed the performance of a variety of GSEA modalities and provide guidance in the practical use of GSEA in RNA-seq experiments. We leveraged harmonized RNA-seq datasets available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) in combination with large, curated pathway collections from the Molecular Signatures Database to obtain cancer-type-specific target pathway lists across multiple cancer types. We carried out a detailed analysis of GSEA performance using both gene-set and phenotype permutations combined with four different choices for the Kolmogorov- Smirnov enrichment statistic. Based on our benchmarks, we conclude that the classic/ unweighted gene-set permutation approach offered comparable or better sensitivity-vsspecificity tradeoffs across cancer types compared with other, more complex and computationally intensive permutation methods. Finally, we analyzed other large cohorts for thyroid cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. We utilized a new consensus metric, the Enrichment Evidence Score (EES), which showed a remarkable agreement between pathways identified in TCGA and those from other sources, despite differences in cancer etiology. This finding suggests an EES-based strategy to identify a core set of pathways that may be complemented by an expanded set of pathways for downstream exploratory analysis.

Telomeres, protective caps on the ends of chromosomes, regulate both cellular aging and cancer formation. In most cancers, telomerase is upregulated, with the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) enzyme and telomerase RNA component (TERC) RNA element contributing to the maintenance of telomere length. Additionally, it is noteworthy that two viruses, human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), utilize telomerase for their replication or persistence in infected cells. Also, TERT and TERC may play major roles in cancer not related to telomere biology. They are involved in the regulation of gene expression, signal transduction pathways, cellular metabolism, or even immune response modulation. Furthermore, the crosstalk between TERT, TERC, RNA-binding proteins, and microRNAs contributes to a greater extent to cancer biology. To understand the multifaceted roles played by TERT and TERC in cancer and viral life cycles, and then to develop effective therapeutic strategies against these diseases, are fundamental for this goal. By investigating deeply, the complicated mechanisms and relationships between TERT and TERC, scientists will open the doors to new therapies.

It encompasses frequent opioid usage, cravings, the development of tolerance, withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation, unsuccessful attempts to quit or reduce use, and recurrent use even when faced with negative consequences. Both national-and state-level data show that overdose deaths associated with prescription opioids are increasing at an alarming rate. The increasing overdose deaths from illicitly manufactured fentanyl and other synthetic opioids compound this epidemic's burden. The present study sought to determine the prevalence and potential factors associated with OUD in North Carolina. Methods Using the State Inpatient Database, a retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted to identify OUD-related discharges between 2000 and 2020. Descriptive statistics and rates of OUD per 1000 discharges were calculated. Simple and multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with increased odds of having an opioid use disorder diagnosis at discharge. The deviance-Pearson goodness of fit statistic was also used. Variables were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification, codes in the discharge records. Results Of 19,370,483 hospitalizations that occurred between 2000 and 2020 in North Carolina, 483,250 were associated with OUD, a prevalence rate of 24.9 cases per 1000 discharges. The highest OUD rates were seen among adults who self-paid for their hospitalization, those with Medicaid, and those with other types of payors such as Workers' Compensation and the Indian Health Service; individuals between 25 and 54 years old; tobacco and alcohol users; Native American patients; patients located in urban areas; patients with lower household income; White patients; and female patients. OUD also was associated with increased odds of having one or more comorbid psychiatric disorders when controlling for other factors. Conclusions Although preventive measures are crucial, including policies that discourage prescribing opioids for noncancer pain and those that target the manufacturing and distribution of synthetic opioids, providing integrated care for patients with OUD and co-occurring psychiatric and/or physical disorders is equally important.

To address this question, we assessed the role of immune resilience (capacity to restore immune functions), operationalized as the neutrophil-to-lymphocytes ratio (NL-ratio) and monocytes-to-lymphocytes ratio (ML-ratio), in the pathway that from robust status shifts to pre-frailty and frailty, and finally to death. The InCHIANTI study enrolled representative samples from the registry lists of 2 towns in Tuscany, Italy. Baseline data were collected in 1998, with follow-up visits every 3 years. The 1 453 participants enrolled were assessed and followed for lifestyle, clinical condition, physical performance, clinical, and physiological measures. For the purpose of this analysis, we used only 1 022 subjects aged 65 or older at baseline. Participants in the 3 highest deciles of distribution for NL-ratio (>2.44) were more likely to experience a transition from robust to pre-frail, and to overt frailty status.

The 2 leucocytes-derived ratios, NL-ratio and ML-ratio, represent markers of immune resilience and predict changes in physical resilience and mortality.

Methods: The relationship between GDF15 and diet quality trajectories in relation to incident frailty was examined in a longitudinal study of participants in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (2004–2017). Serum GDF15 concentration and frailty incidence were primary exposure and outcome, respectively.

Results: Black/African Americans compared to non-Hispanic whites were at significantly higher odds of having a childhood-onset persistent trajectory through young adulthood (OR = 2.58, 95% CI [1.29, 5.14]), while Hispanics/Latinx were at nonsignificantly higher odds to have the same trajectory (OR = 1.81, 95% CI [0.77, 4.25]). No significant racial/ethnic differences were observed for remitted and waxing-and-waning trajectories since childhood or incident/new-onset trajectories in young adulthood. Conclusions: The results indicate that disparities in insomnia symptoms among black/African American and, to a lesser extent, Hispanic/Latinx groups start early in childhood and persist into young adulthood. Identifying and intervening upon upstream determinants of racial/ethnic insomnia disparities are warranted to directly address these disparities and to prevent their adverse health sequelae.

Understanding the heterogeneity of structural brain changes in aging may provide insights into preclinical stages of neurodegenerative diseases. Objective: To derive subgroups with common patterns of variation in participants without diagnosed cognitive impairment (WODCI) in a data-driven manner and relate them to genetics, biomedical measures, and cognitive decline trajectories. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data acquisition for this cohort study was performed from 1999 to 2020. Data consolidation and harmonization were conducted from July 2017 to July 2021. Age-specific subgroups of structural brain measures were modeled in 4 decade-long intervals spanning ages 45 to 85 years using a deep learning, semisupervised clustering method leveraging generative adversarial networks. Data were analyzed from July 2021 to February 2023 and were drawn from the Imaging-Based Coordinate System for Aging and Neurodegenerative Diseases (iSTAGING) international consortium. Individuals WODCI at baseline spanning ages 45 to 85 years were included, with greater than 50000 data time points. Exposures: Individuals WODCI at baseline scan. Main Outcomes and Measures: Three subgroups, consistent across decades, were identified within the WODCI population. Associations with genetics, cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs), amyloid β (Aβ), and future cognitive decline were assessed. Results: In a sample of 27402 individuals (mean [SD] age, 63.0 [8.3] years; 15146 female [55%]) WODCI, 3 subgroups were identified in contrast with the reference group: a typical aging subgroup, A1, with a specific pattern of modest atrophy and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) load, and 2 accelerated aging subgroups, A2 and A3, with characteristics that were more distinct at age 65 years and older. A2 was associated with hypertension, WMH, and vascular disease-related genetic variants and was enriched for Aβ positivity (ages ≥65 years) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ϵ4 carriers. A3 showed severe, widespread atrophy, moderate presence of CVRFs, and greater cognitive decline. Genetic variants associated with A1 were protective for WMH (rs7209235: mean [SD] B = -0.07 [0.01]; P value = 2.31 × 10-9) and Alzheimer disease (rs72932727: mean [SD] B = 0.1 [0.02]; P value = 6.49 × 10-9), whereas the converse was observed for A2 (rs7209235: mean [SD] B = 0.1 [0.01]; P value = 1.73 × 10-15and rs72932727: mean [SD] B = -0.09 [0.02]; P value = 4.05 × 10-7, respectively); variants in A3 were associated with regional atrophy (rs167684: mean [SD] B = 0.08 [0.01]; P value = 7.22 × 10-12) and white matter integrity measures (rs1636250: mean [SD] B = 0.06 [0.01]; P value = 4.90 × 10-7).

We aimed to determine whether genetic predisposition to higher serum iron status biomarkers increased risk of dementia and atrophy of grey matter. Methods We analysed UK Biobank participants clustered into European (N=451284), African (N=7477) and South Asian (N=9570) groups by genetic similarity to the 1000 genomes project. Using Mendelian randomisation methods, we estimated the association between genetically predicted serum iron (transferrin saturation [TSAT] and ferritin), grey matter volume and genetic liability to clinically defined dementia (including Alzheimer’s disease [AD], non-AD dementia, and vascular dementia) from hospital and primary care records. We also performed time-to-event (competing risks) analysis of the TSAT polygenic score on risk of clinically defined non-AD dementia. Results In Europeans, higher genetically predicted TSAT increased genetic liability to dementia (Odds Ratio [OR]: 1.15, 95% Confidence Intervals [CI] 1.04 to 1.26, p=0.0051), non-AD dementia (OR: 1.27, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.45, p=0.00018) and vascular dementia (OR: 1.37, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.69, p=0.0023), but not AD (OR: 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15, p=0.97).

Methods: We comprehensively investigated the genetic relationship between PD and depression using genome-wide association studies data. First, we estimated the genetic correlation at the genome-wide level using linkage-disequilibrium score regression, followed by local genetic correlation analysis using the GWAS-pairwise method and functional annotation to identify genes that may jointly influence the risk for both traits. Also, we performed Latent Causal Variable, Latent Heritable Confounder Mendelian Randomization, and traditional Mendelian Randomization analyses to investigate the potential causal relationship. Results: Although the genetic correlation between PD and depression was not statistically significant at the genome-wide level, GWAS-pairwise analyses identified 16 genomic segments associated with PD and depression, implicating nine genes. Further analyses revealed distinct patterns within individual genes, suggesting an intricate pattern.

Induction of cellular senescence by several triggers in vitro correlates with upregulation of Sprouty protein levels. More importantly, overexpression of Sprouty genes is sufficient to cause premature cellular senescence, via a conserved N-terminal tyrosine (Tyrosine 53 of Sprouty1). Accordingly, fibroblasts from knockin animals lacking that tyrosine escape replicative senescence. In vivo, heterozygous knockin mice display delayed induction of cellular senescence during cutaneous wound healing and upon chemotherapy-induced cellular senescence.

How sex, age, and sex steroid concentrations impact B cells and durability of IIV-induced immunity and protection over 4 months post-vaccination (mpv) was analyzed. Vaccinated adult females had greater germinal center B cell and plasmablast frequencies in lymphoid tissues, higher neutralizing antibody responses 1-4 mpv, and better protection against live H1N1 challenge than adult males. Aged mice, regardless of sex, had reduced B cell frequencies, less durable antibody responses, and inferior protection after challenge than adult mice, which correlated with diminished estradiol among aged females. To confirmthat greater IIV-induced immunity was caused by sex hormones, four core genotype (FCG) mice were used, in which the testes-determining gene, Sry, was deleted from chromosome Y (ChrY) and transferred to Chr3 to separate gonadal sex (i.e., ovaries or testes) from sex chromosome complement (i.e., XX or XY complement). Vaccinated, gonadal female FCG mice (XXF and XYF) had greater numbers of B cells, higher antiviral antibody titers, and reduced pulmonary virus titers following live H1N1 challenge than gonadal FCG males (XYM and XXM). To establish that lower estradiol concentrations cause diminished immunity, adult and aged females received either a placebo or estradiol replacement therapy prior to IIV. Estradiol replacement significantlyincreased IIV-induced antibody responses and reduced morbidity after the H1N1 challenge among aged females.

While many factors like smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, a sedentary lifestyle, and genetic factors can predispose to cardiovascular diseases, the natural process of aging is by itself a major determinant of the risk. Cardiac aging is marked by a conglomerate of cellular and molecular changes, exacerbated by age-driven decline in cardiac regeneration capacity. Although the phenotypes of cardiac aging are well characterised, the underlying molecular mechanisms are far less explored. Recent advances unequivocally link cardiovascular aging to the dysregulation of critical signalling pathways in cardiac fibroblasts, which compromises the critical role of these cells in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the myocardium. Clearly, the identification of cardiac fibroblast-specific factors and mechanisms that regulate cardiac fibroblast function in the senescent myocardium is of immense importance. In this regard, recent studies show that Discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2), a collagen-activated receptor tyrosine kinase predominantly located in cardiac fibroblasts, has an obligate role in cardiac fibroblast function and cardiovascular fibrosis.

Methods: A total of 553 adults (mean age 75.8 ± 8.4 years, 54.4% women) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) completed a health interview and subsequent 7-day wrist-worn ActiGraph assessment in the free-living environment between 2015 and 2020.

PA metrics were summarized into total daily activity counts (TAC), activity fragmentation, active minutes/day, and diurnal patterns of activity. Linear regression models and mixed-effects models examined the association between pain characteristics and PA outcomes, adjusted for demographics and comorbidities. Results: Unilateral knee pain was associated with 184 070 fewer TAC (p = .039) and 36.2 fewer active minutes/day (p = .032) compared to those without knee pain. Older adults with shoulder pain or hand/wrist pain had more active minutes compared to those without pain (p < .05 for all). For diurnal patterns of activity, participants with knee pain had fewer activity counts during the afternoon (12:00 pm to 5:59 pm).

Removal of these biases in T1w MRI images is a critical preprocessing step to ensure spatially consistent image interpretation. N4ITK bias field correction, the current state-of-the-art, is implemented in such a way that makes it difficult to port between different pipelines and workflows, thus making it hard to reimplement and reproduce results across local, cloud, and edge platforms. Moreover, N4ITK is opaque to optimization before and after its application, meaning that methodological development must work around the inhomogeneity correction step. Given the importance of bias fields correction in structural preprocessing and flexible implementation, we pursue a deep learning approximation / reinterpretation of the N4ITK bias fields correction to create a method which is portable, flexible, and fully differentiable. In this paper, we trained a deep learning network “DeepN4” on eight independent cohorts from 72 different scanners and age ranges with N4ITK-corrected T1w MRI and bias field for supervision in log space. We found that we can closely approximate N4ITK bias fields correction with naïve networks. We evaluate the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) in test dataset against the N4ITK corrected images. The median PSNR of corrected images between N4ITK and DeepN4 was 47.96 dB. In addition, we assess the DeepN4 model on eight additional external datasets and show the generalizability of the approach.

We previously reported that genetic deletion and pharmacological antagonism of the cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1) in mice improves insulin synthesis and secretion, upregulates glucose sensing machinery, favors beta cell survival by reducing apoptosis, and enhances beta cell proliferation. Moreover, beta cell specific deletion of CB1 protected mice fed a high fat high sugar diet against islet inflammation and beta cell dysfunction. Therefore, we hypothesized that it would mitigate the dysfunction of beta cells in the precipitating events leading to T1D. Methods: We genetically deleted CB1 specifically from beta cells in non-obese diabetic (NOD; NOD RIP Cre+ Cnr1fl/fl) mice. We evaluated female NOD RIP Cre+ Cnr1fl/fl mice and their NOD RIP Cre− Cnr1fl/fl and NOD RIP Cre+ Cnr1Wt/Wt littermates for onset of hyperglycemia over 26 weeks. We also examined islet morphology, islet infiltration by immune cells and beta cell function and proliferation. Results: Beta cell specific deletion of CB1 in NOD mice significantly reduced the incidence of hyperglycemia by preserving beta cell function and mass. Deletion also prevented beta cell apoptosis and aggressive insulitis in NOD RIP Cre+ Cnr1fl/fl mice compared to wild-type littermates. NOD RIP Cre+ Cnr1fl/fl islets maintained normal morphology with no evidence of beta cell dedifferentiation or appearance of extra islet beta cells, indicating that protection from autoimmunity is inherent to genetic deletion of beta cell CB1. Pancreatic lymph node Treg cells were significantly higher in NOD RIP Cre+ Cnr1fl/fl vs NOD RIP Cre− Cnr1fl/fl.

Damaging coding variants in Glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) are a genetic risk factor for RBD. Recently, a population-specific non-coding risk variant (rs3115534) was found to be associated with PD risk and earlier onset in individuals of African ancestry. Objectives: We aimed to investigate whether the GBA1 rs3115534 PD risk variant is associated with RBD in persons with PD. Methods: We studied 709 persons with PD and 776 neurologically healthy controls from Nigeria. All DNA samples were genotyped and imputed, and the GBA1 rs3115534 risk variant was extracted. The RBD screening questionnaire (RBDSQ) was used to assess symptoms of possible RBD. Results: RBD was present in 200 PD (28.2%) and 51 (6.6%) controls. We identified that the non-coding GBA1 rs3115534 risk variant is associated with possible RBD in individuals of Nigerian origin (β, 0.3640; standard error [SE], 0.103, P = 4.093e−04), as well as in all samples after adjusting for PD status (β, 0.2542; SE, 0.108; P = 0.019) suggesting that although non-coding, this variant may have the same downstream consequences as GBA1 coding variants. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the non-coding GBA1 rs3115534 risk variant is associated with an increasing number of RBD symptoms in persons with PD of Nigerian origin.

As such, interventions that are broadly efficacious might be considered prominent compounds for translation for pre-clinical research and human clinical applications. Here, we report results generated using a recently streamlined pipeline approach for the evaluation of the effects of chemical compounds on lifespan and health.

Additionally, these two antioxidants conferred assay-specific effects in some studies—for example, decreasing survival for certain genetic backgrounds in manual survival assays in contrast with extended lifespan as assayed using automated C. elegans Lifespan Machines. We also observed that GTE and NDGA impact on older adult mobility capacity is dependent on genetic background, and that GTE reduces oxidative stress resistance in some Caenorhabditis strains.

Longitudinally, the annual decline was 0.004 (95% CI, 0.002-0.007) m/s/year faster for those with hyposmia and 0.01 (95% CI, 0.007-0.013) m/s/year faster for those with anosmia. Similar results were obtained for the 20-m and 400-m fast walking tests. Further, compared with participants with good olfaction, the odds of being unable to do the 400-m test were 2.02 (95% CI, 1.17-3.48) times higher for those with anosmia at the year 8 visit and 2.73 (95% CI, 1.40-5.35) times higher at year 10. Multiple sensitivity and subgroup analyses supported the robustness and generalizability of the findings. Conclusion and Relevance: The results of this cohort study suggest that poor olfaction is associated with a faster decline in mobility in older adults.

Objective: To investigate longitudinal associations of the type, severity, and number of sensory impairments with physical function trajectories and mortality in older adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective analysis of a longitudinal cohort study, the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) study, incorporated data from April 1997 to July 2013, featuring a 16-year follow-up with annual examinations and questionnaires. The cohort comprised 3075 men and women, aged 70 to 79 years at baseline, residing in Memphis, Tennessee, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. All participants with complete sensory testing and covariate data at analytical baseline (year 5, 2002) were included. The data were analyzed September 1, 2022. Exposures: Visual, olfactory, auditory, and touch sensory functions were assessed between 2000 and 2002. Main Outcomes: The main outcomes included physical functioning trajectories and mortality risk. Physical function was assessed longitudinally using the Health ABC physical performance battery (HABCPPB). Results: A total of 1825 individuals (mean [SD] age, 77.4 [3.2] years; 957 [52%] female) were included in this study.

Therefore, it is challenging to accurately identify individuals at increased risk for dementia. We aimed to identify different brain MRI phenotypes by hierarchical clustering analysis based on combined neurovascular and neurodegenerative brain MRI markers and to determine the long-term dementia risk within the brain MRI phenotype subgroups.MethodsHierarchical clustering analysis based on 32 combined neurovascular and neurodegenerative brain MRI markers in community-dwelling individuals of the Age-Gene/Environment Susceptibility Reykjavik Study was applied to identify brain MRI phenotypes. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to determine the long-term risk for dementia per subgroup.ResultsWe included 3,056 participants and identified 15 subgroups with distinct brain MRI phenotypes. The phenotypes ranged from limited burden, mostly irregular white matter hyperintensity (WMH) shape and cerebral atrophy, mostly irregularly WMHs and microbleeds, mostly cortical infarcts and atrophy, mostly irregularly shaped WMH and cerebral atrophy to multiburden subgroups. Each subgroup showed different long-term risks for dementia (min-max range hazard ratios [HRs] 1.01-6.18; mean time to follow-up 9.9 ± 2.6 years); especially the brain MRI phenotype with mainly WMHs and atrophy showed a large increased risk (HR 6.18, 95% CI 3.37-11.32).DiscussionDistinct brain MRI phenotypes can be identified in community-dwelling older adults.

We characterized 19 cervical and four head and neck cancer cell lines using long-read DNA and RNA sequencing and identified the HPV types, HPV integration sites, chromosomal alterations, and cancer driver mutations. Structural variation analysis revealed telomeric deletions associated with DNA inversions resulting from breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles. BFB is a common mechanism of chromosomal alterations in cancer, and our study applies long-read sequencing to this important chromosomal rearrangement type. Analysis of the inversion sites revealed staggered ends consistent with exonuclease digestion of the DNA after breakage. Some BFB events are complex, involving inter- or intra-chromosomal insertions or rearrangements. None of the BFB breakpoints had telomere sequences added to resolve the dicentric chromosomes, and only one BFB breakpoint showed chromothripsis. Five cell lines have a chromosomal region 11q BFB event, with YAP1-BIRC3-BIRC2 amplification. Indeed, YAP1 amplification is associated with a 10-year-earlier age of diagnosis of cervical cancer and is three times more common in African American women.

ComBat is a leading approach for addressing these site biases. However, despite its frequent use for harmonization, ComBat’s robustness toward site dissimilarities and overall cohort size have not yet been evaluated in terms of DTI. Approach: As a baseline, we match N = 358 participants from two sites to create a “silver standard” that simulates a cohort for multi-site harmonization. Across sites, we harmonize mean fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity, calculated using participant DTI data, for the regions of interest defined by the JHU EVE-Type III atlas. We bootstrap 10 iterations at 19 levels of total sample size, 10 levels of sample size imbalance between sites, and 6 levels of mean age difference between sites to quantify (i) βAGE, the linear regression coefficient of the relationship between FA and age; (ii) γ̂∗sf , the ComBat-estimated site-shift; and (iii) δ̂∗sf , the ComBat-estimated site-scaling. We characterize the reliability of ComBat by evaluating the root mean squared error in these three metrics and examine if there is a correlation between the reliability of ComBat and a violation of assumptions. Results: ComBat remains well behaved for βAGE when N > 162 and when the mean age difference is less than 4 years. The assumptions of the ComBat model regarding the normality of residual distributions are not violated as the model becomes unstable. Conclusion: Prior to harmonization of DTI data with ComBat, the input cohort should be examined for size and covariate distributions of each site. Direct assessment of residual distributions is less informative on stability than bootstrap analysis.

However, longitudinal analysis of body composition changes using these scans is difficult due to positional variation between slices acquired in different years, which leads to different organs/ tissues being captured. Approach: To address this issue, we propose C-SliceGen, which takes an arbitrary axial slice in the abdominal region as a condition and generates a pre-defined vertebral level slice by estimating structural changes in the latent space. Results: Our experiments on 2608 volumetric CT data from two in-house datasets and 50 subjects from the 2015 Multi-Atlas Abdomen Labeling Challenge Beyond the Cranial Vault (BTCV) dataset demonstrate that our model can generate high-quality images that are realistic and similar. We further evaluate our method’s capability to harmonize longitudinal positional variation on 1033 subjects from the Baltimore longitudinal study of aging dataset, which contains longitudinal single abdominal slices, and confirmed that our method can harmonize the slice positional variance in terms of visceral fat area.

Leveraging advances in omics techniques to characterize these health conditions may provide insight into disease pathogenesis as well as reveal biomarkers for monitoring, prognostication, and diagnosis. Researchers have previously established the utility of big data approaches with respect to comprehensive health outcome measurements in younger populations, identifying protein markers that may provide significant health information with a single blood sample. Methods: Here, we employed a similar approach in two cohorts of older adults, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (mean age = 76.12 years) and InCHIANTI Study (mean age = 66.05 years), examining the relationship between levels of serum proteins and 5 key health outcomes: kidney function, fasting glucose, physical activity, lean body mass, and percent body fat. Results: Correlations between proteins and health outcomes were primarily shared across both older adult cohorts. We further identified that most proteins associated with health outcomes in the older adult cohorts were not associated with the same outcomes in a prior study of a younger population. A subset of proteins, adiponectin, MIC-1, and NCAM-120, were associated with at least three health outcomes in both older adult cohorts but not in the previously published younger cohort, suggesting that they may represent plausible markers of general health in older adult populations. Conclusion: Taken together, these findings suggest that comprehensive protein health markers have utility in aging populations and are distinct from those identified in younger adults, indicating unique mechanisms of disease with aging.",0,38219723,Journal,ar,Article,100,13,13,29071,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,333,Aging | Diabetes | Health | Physical activity | Proteomics,NIH,National Institutes of Health,NA,NA

Design: Retrospective longitudinal study. Setting and Participants: In adults aged ≥65 years who developed cognitive impairment or dementia, we compared cognitive and health profiles of those who did (n = 57) and did not (n = 86) experience slow gait up to 14 years before symptom onset. Measures of cognitive and biomarkers assessed longitudinally over an average of 7 years before symptom onset were compared between groups using linear mixed effects models, adjusted age, sex, race, and additionally adjusted for education for cognitive outcomes. Results: Compared to those without prior slow gait, those with slow gait had lower Digit Symbol Substitution Test and Pegboard dominant and nondominant hand performance. The slow gait group also had greater body mass index (BMI), waist, systolic blood pressure, lower high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein, and lower lysophosphatidylcholine 18:2, a lipid associated with mitochondrial function, and showed greater increases in 2-hour glucose levels of an oral glucose tolerance test. The slow gait group was more likely to take medication for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Conclusions and Implications: During the presymptomatic stage, cognitively impaired older persons who experience prior slow gait are more likely to have deficits in psychomotor speed and manual dexterity, an unfavorable metabolic and vascular profile, and lower lipid levels related to mitochondrial function.

Changes in the gut microbiome and microbiome-dependent metabolites, such as trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), may explain differential health effects of plant-based diets. However, human data are sparse on whether qualitatively distinct types of plant-based diets differentially affect gut microbiome diversity, composition, particularly at the species level, and/or metabolites. Objectives: We aimed to examine cross-sectional associations of different plant-based indices with adult gut microbiome diversity, composition, and the metabolite TMAO. Methods: We studied 705 adults in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging with data for diet, fecal microbiome (shotgun metagenomic sequencing), and key covariates. We derived healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI) and unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI) using data from food frequency questionnaires. We examined plant-based diet indices with microbiome α-diversity (richness and evenness measures), β-diversity (Bray–Curtis and UniFrac measures), composition (species level), and plasma TMAO. We used regression models to determine associations before and after adjustment for age, sex, education, physical activity, smoking status, body mass index, and total energy intake. Results: The analytic sample (mean age, 71.0 years, SD = 12.8 years) comprised 55.6% female and 67.5% non-Hispanic White participants. hPDI was positively and uPDI negatively associated with microbiome α-diversity, driven by microbial evenness (Pielou P < 0.05). hPDI was also positively associated with relative abundance of 3 polysaccharide-degrading bacterial species (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Eubacterium eligens, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron) and inversely associated with 6 species (Blautia hydrogenotrophica, Dorea sp CAG 317, Eisenbergiella massiliensis, Sellimonas intestinalis, Blautia wexlerae, and Alistipes shahii). Furthermore, hPDI was inversely associated with TMAO. Associations did not differ by age, sex, or race.

Plasma from hyperglycemic glucose clamp experiments were also used to isolate and measure EV insulin content in response to a secretory stimulus. We performed immunogold electron microscopy for insulin presence in EVs. Co-culture experiments of isolated EVs with fresh islets were performed to examine the effect of EV cargo on insulin receptor signaling. Key findings: EVs isolated from culture medium contained insulin. Glucose treatment of islets increased the level of EV insulin. Hyperglycemic glucose clamp experiments in humans also lead to increased levels of insulin in plasma-derived EVs. Immunogold electron microscopy and proteinase K-digestion experiments demonstrated that insulin in EVs predominantly associated with the exterior surface of EVs while western blot analyses uncovered the presence of only preproinsulin in EVs. Membrane-bound preproinsulin in EVs was capable of activating insulin signaling pathway in an insulin receptor-dependent manner. The physiological relevance of this finding was observed in priming of human naïve islets by EVs during glucose stimulated insulin secretion.

Head injury was defined using self-reported and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code data.

Previous falls were associated with an increased fracture risk in women and men and should be considered as an additional risk factor in the FRAX® algorithm. Introduction: Previous falls are a well-documented risk factor for subsequent fracture but have not yet been incorporated into the FRAX algorithm. The aim of this study was to evaluate, in an international meta-analysis, the association between previous falls and subsequent fracture risk and its relation to sex, age, duration of follow-up, and bone mineral density (BMD). Methods: The resource comprised 906,359 women and men (66.9% female) from 46 prospective cohorts. Previous falls were uniformly defined as any fall occurring during the previous year in 43 cohorts; the remaining three cohorts had a different question construct. The association between previous falls and fracture risk (any clinical fracture, osteoporotic fracture, major osteoporotic fracture, and hip fracture) was examined using an extension of the Poisson regression model in each cohort and each sex, followed by random-effects meta-analyses of the weighted beta coefficients. Results: Falls in the past year were reported in 21.4% of individuals. During a follow-up of 9,102,207 person-years, 87,352 fractures occurred of which 19,509 were hip fractures. A previous fall was associated with a significantly increased risk of any clinical fracture both in women (hazard ratio (HR) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33–1.51) and men (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.41–1.67). The HRs were of similar magnitude for osteoporotic, major osteoporotic fracture, and hip fracture. Sex significantly modified the association between previous fall and fracture risk, with predictive values being higher in men than in women (e.g., for major osteoporotic fracture, HR 1.53 (95% CI 1.27–1.84) in men vs. HR 1.32 (95% CI 1.20–1.45) in women, P for interaction = 0.013). The HRs associated with previous falls decreased with age in women and with duration of follow-up in men and women for most fracture outcomes. There was no evidence of an interaction between falls and BMD for fracture risk. Subsequent risk for a major osteoporotic fracture increased with each additional previous fall in women and men. Conclusions: A previous self-reported fall confers an increased risk of fracture that is largely independent of BMD.

Objectives: Inspired by pathogenic structural variation implicated in other 16q-ataxias with linkage to the same locus, we revisited the index SCA4 cases from the Utah family using novel technologies to investigate structural variation within the candidate region. Methods: We adopted a targeted long-read sequencing approach with adaptive sampling on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platform that enables the detection of segregating structural variants within a genomic region without a priori assumptions about any variant features. Results: Using this approach, we found a heterozygous (GGC)n repeat expansion in the last coding exon of the zinc finger homeobox 3 (ZFHX3) gene that segregates with disease, ranging between 48 and 57 GGC repeats in affected probands. This finding was replicated in a separate family with SCA4.

Results: During 8.8±3.2 years of follow-up, 843 persons developed dementia, including 397 with AD. Current MDD was associated with an increased risk of developing all-cause dementia (HR = 2.17; 95% CI 1.66-2.67), with risks similar for AD and non-AD, while remitted MDD was not (HR = 1.02; 95% CI 0.55-1.49). Depressive symptoms were also associated with increased risk of dementia, in particular non-AD dementias. Higher levels of evening cortisol increased risk of dementia, but this was independent of MDD. WMH partially explained the relation between current MDD and dementia risk but remained increased (HR = 1.71; 95% CI 1.34-2.08). Conclusion: The current study highlights the importance of LLD in developing dementia. However, neither the glucocorticoid cascade nor the vascular hypotheses fully explained the relation between depression and dementia.",0,NA,Book,ch,Book Chapter,100,6,6,21101211875,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,344,Cerebrovascular disorders | Cohort studies | Dementia | Depression,NA,NA,NA,NA

Epicatechin (EPI), a naturally occurring flavanol, has antioxidant properties that may mediate the beneficial effects of natural products such as cocoa. In a phase II randomized trial, a cocoa-flavanol-rich beverage significantly improved walking performance compared with a placebo in people with PAD. In the present work, the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effect of cocoa flavanols were investigated by analyzing baseline and follow-up muscle biopsies from participants. Increases in nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) target antioxidants heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1 (NQO1) in the cocoa group were significantly associated with reduced accumulation of central nuclei, a myopathy indicator, in type II muscle fibers (P = 0.017 and P = 0.023, respectively). Protein levels of the mitochondrial respiratory complex III subunit, cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 2 (UQCRC2), were significantly higher in the cocoa group than in the placebo group (P = 0.032), and increases in UQCRC2 were significantly associated with increased levels of Nrf2 target antioxidants HO-1 and NQO1 (P = 0.001 and P = 0.035, respectively). Exposure of non-PAD human myotubes to ex vivo serum from patients with PAD reduced Nrf2 phosphorylation, an indicator of activation, increased hydrogen peroxide production and oxidative stress, and reduced mitochondrial respiration. Treatment of myotubes with EPI in the presence of serum from patients with PAD increased Nrf2 phosphorylation and protected against PAD serum-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Overall, these findings suggest that cocoa flavanols may enhance antioxidant capacity in PAD via Nrf2 activation. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The current study supports the hypothesis that in people with PAD, cocoa flavanols activate Nrf2, thereby increasing antioxidant protein levels, protecting against skeletal muscle damage, and increasing mitochondrial protein abundance. These results suggest that Nrf2 activation may be an important therapeutic target for improving walking performance in people with PAD.",12,38189132,Journal,ar,Article,100,10,10,23306,2022–67012-38533,0,FALSE,NA,NA,349,antioxidants | epicatechin | Nrf2 | oxidative stress | peripheral artery disease,USDA,U.S. Department of Agriculture,NA,NA

We propose that, given biomarker advances enabling accurate detection of pathological α-synuclein (ie, misfolded and aggregated) in CSF using the seed amplification assay, it is time to redefine Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies as neuronal α-synuclein disease rather than as clinical syndromes. This major shift from a clinical to a biological definition of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies takes advantage of the availability of tools to assess the gold standard for diagnosis of neuronal α-synuclein (n-αsyn) in human beings during life. Neuronal α-synuclein disease is defined by the presence of pathological n-αsyn species detected in vivo (S; the first biological anchor) regardless of the presence of any specific clinical syndrome. On the basis of this definition, we propose that individuals with pathological n-αsyn aggregates are at risk for dopaminergic neuronal dysfunction (D; the second biological anchor). Our biological definition establishes a staging system, the neuronal α-synuclein disease integrated staging system (NSD-ISS), rooted in the biological anchors (S and D) and the degree of functional impairment caused by clinical signs or symptoms. Stages 0–1 occur without signs or symptoms and are defined by the presence of pathogenic variants in the SNCA gene (stage 0), S alone (stage 1A), or S and D (stage 1B). The presence of clinical manifestations marks the transition to stage 2 and beyond. Stage 2 is characterised by subtle signs or symptoms but without functional impairment. Stages 2B–6 require both S and D and stage-specific increases in functional impairment. A biological definition of neuronal α-synuclein disease and an NSD-ISS research framework are essential to enable interventional trials at early disease stages. The NSD-ISS will evolve to include the incorporation of data-driven definitions of stage-specific functional anchors and additional biomarkers as they emerge and are validated.

It remains unknown whether fatigability anchored to a physical task is a more sensitive prognostic indicator and whether sensitivity differs by prevalent chronic conditions. Methods: A total of 1076 physically well-functioning participants 50 yr or older in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging self-reported fatigue (unusual tiredness or low energy) and had perceived fatigability assessed after a standardized treadmill walk. All-cause mortality was ascertained by proxy contact and National Death Index linkage. Cox proportional hazards models estimated associations of perceived fatigability and fatigue with all-cause mortality, adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates. Interactions by chronic conditions were also examined. Results: Each 1 SD higher in perceived fatigability, unusual tiredness, or low energy was associated with a higher relative hazard of all-cause mortality after covariate adjustment (fatigability: hazard ratio (HR), 1.18 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03–1.36); unusual tiredness: HR, 1.25 (95% CI, 1.08–1.44); low energy: HR, 1.27 (95% CI, 1.10–1.46)).

Conclusions: Higher perceived fatigability and fatigue symptoms were similarly associated with higher all-cause mortality, but utility differed by chronic condition.

We aimed to examine the association between skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and cognitive and mobility outcomes and tested the mediation effect of inflammation or fat infiltration. Methods: We analysed data from 596 Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants who had concurrent data on skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and cognitive and mobility measures of interest (mean age: 66.1, 55% women, 24% Black). Skeletal muscle oxidative capacity was assessed as post-exercise recovery rate (kPCr) via P31 MR spectroscopy. Fat infiltration was measured as intermuscular fat (IMF) via CT scan and was available for 541 participants. Inflammation markers [IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), total white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), or albumin] were available in 594 participants. We examined the association of kPCr and cognitive and mobility measures using linear regression and tested the mediation effect of IMF or inflammation using the mediation package in R. Models were adjusted for demographics and PCr depletion. Results: kPCr and IMF were both significantly associated with specific cognitive domains (DSST, TMA-A, and pegboard dominant hand performance) and mobility (usual gait speed, HABCPPB, 400 m walk time) (all P < 0.05). IMF significantly mediated the relationship between kPCr and these cognitive and mobility measures (all P < 0.05, proportion mediated 13.1% to 27%). Total WBC, neutrophil count, and ESR, but not IL-6 or CRP, also mediated at least one of the cognitive and mobility outcomes (all P < 0.05, proportion mediated 9.4% to 15.3%).

However, genetic susceptibility factors for specific PD subtypes are not well understood. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the genetics of PD heterogeneity by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PD subtypes. Methods: A total of 799 PD patients were included and classified into tremor-dominant (TD) (N = 345), akinetic-rigid (AR) (N = 227), gait-difficulty (GD) (N = 82), and mixed (MX) (N = 145) phenotypic subtypes. After array genotyping and subsequent imputation, a total of 7,918,344 variants were assessed for association with each PD subtype using logistic regression models that were adjusted for age, sex, and the top five principal components of GWAS data. Results: We identified one genome-wide significant association (P < 5 × 10−8), which was between the MIR3976HG rs7504760 variant and the AR subtype (Odds ratio [OR] = 6.12, P = 2.57 × 10−8).

The age-associated loss of muscle has been termed sarcopenia. The muscle is the primary site of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal and the largest component of basal metabolic rate, directly and indirectly affects bone density, produces myokines with pleiotropic effect on muscle and other tissues including the brain, and stores essential amino acids essential for the maintenance of protein synthesis during periods of reduced food intake and stress. As such, not surprisingly deterioration of skeletal muscle health, typically operationalized as decline of muscle mass and muscle strength is both a powerful risk factor and main consequence of chronic diseases, disability, and loss of independence, and it is one of the strongest risk factors for mortality. However, skeletal muscle remains one of the most plastic of all tissues, with rapid changes in rates of protein synthesis and degradation in response to physical activity and inactivity, inflammation, and nutritional and hormonal status. This has made the development of pharmacological therapies to increase muscle mass (or prevent loss), an important goal for decades.

The present study examined the association of 14 protein-based health indicators with plasma and neuroimaging biomarkers of AD and neurodegeneration. Methods: In 706 cognitively normal adults, we examined whether 14 protein-based health indices (ie, SomaSignal® tests) were associated with concurrently measured plasma-based biomarkers of AD pathology (amyloid-β [Aβ]42/40, tau phosphorylated at threonine-181 [pTau-181]), neuronal injury (neurofilament light chain [NfL]), and reactive astrogliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), brain volume, and cortical Aβ and tau. In a separate cohort (n = 11,285), we examined whether protein-based health indicators associated with neurodegeneration also predict 25-year dementia risk. Results: Greater protein-based risk for cardiovascular disease, heart failure mortality, and kidney disease was associated with lower Aβ42/40 and higher pTau-181, NfL, and GFAP levels, even in individuals without cardiovascular or kidney disease. Proteomic indicators of body fat percentage, lean body mass, and visceral fat were associated with pTau-181, NfL, and GFAP, whereas resting energy rate was negatively associated with NfL and GFAP. Together, these health indicators predicted 12, 31, 50, and 33% of plasma Aβ42/40, pTau-181, NfL, and GFAP levels, respectively. Only protein-based measures of cardiovascular risk were associated with reduced regional brain volumes; these measures predicted 25-year dementia risk, even among those without clinically defined cardiovascular disease. Interpretation: Subclinical peripheral health may influence AD and neurodegenerative disease processes and relevant biomarker levels, particularly NfL. Cardiovascular health, even in the absence of clinically defined disease, plays a central role in brain aging and dementia.

Sex-stratified analyses using a linear mixed regression were performed, with a Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) adjustment for multiple testing.

Here, we report that one such protein, Nocte, is essential for Drosophila eye development by regulating a critical gene expression cascade at translational level. Knockout of nocte in flies leads to lethality, and its eye-specific depletion impairs eye size and morphology. Nocte preferentially enhances translation of mRNAs with long upstream open reading frames (uORFs). One of the key Nocte targets, glass mRNA, encodes a transcription factor critical for differentiation of photoreceptor neurons and accessory cells, and re-expression of Glass largely rescued the eye defects caused by Nocte depletion. Mechanistically, Nocte counteracts long uORF-mediated translational suppression by promoting translation reinitiation downstream of the uORF. Nocte interacts with translation factors eIF3 and Rack1 through its BAT2 domain, and a Nocte mutant lacking this domain fails to promote translation of glass mRNA. Notably, de novo mutations of human orthologs of Nocte have been detected in schizophrenia patients. Our data suggest that Nocte family of proteins can promote translation reinitiation to overcome long uORFs-mediated translational suppression, and disruption of this function can lead to developmental defects and neurological disorders.",2,38000373,Journal,ar,Article,100,13,13,14204,AG000686,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,373,NA,NIH,National Institutes of Health,NA,NA

We assessed interactions between biomarkers of low PUFA intake and a family history in relation to long-term CVD risk in a large consortium. METHODS: Blood and tissue PUFA data from 40 885 CVD-free adults were assessed. PUFA levels ≤25th percentile were considered to reflect low intake of linoleic, alpha-linolenic, and eicosapentaenoic/docosahexaenoic acids (EPA/DHA). Family history was defined as having ≥1 first-degree relative who experienced a CVD event. Relative risks with 95% CI of CVD were estimated using Cox regression and meta-analyzed. Interactions were assessed by analyzing product terms and calculating relative excess risk due to interaction. RESULTS: After multivariable adjustments, a significant interaction between low EPA/DHA and family history was observed (product term pooled RR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.02-1.16]; P=0.01). The pooled relative risk of CVD associated with the combined exposure to low EPA/DHA, and family history was 1.41 (95% CI, 1.30-1.54), whereas it was 1.25 (95% CI, 1.16-1.33) for family history alone and 1.06 (95% CI, 0.98-1.14) for EPA/DHA alone, compared with those with neither exposure. The relative excess risk due to interaction results indicated no interactions. CONCLUSIONS: A significant interaction between biomarkers of low EPA/DHA intake, but not the other PUFA, and a family history was observed.

The seminal discovery that filaments derived from TMEM106B is a common feature in aging and, across a range of neurodegenerative disorders, suggests that genetic variants in TMEM106B could modulate disease risk and progression through modulating TMEM106B aggregation. To explore this possibility and assess the pathological relevance of TMEM106B accumulation, we generated a new antibody targeting the TMEM106B filament core sequence.

In contrast, minimal TMEM106B core deposition was detected in carriers of the protective allele. Although the abundance of monomeric full-length TMEM106B was unchanged, carriers of the protective genotype exhibited an increase in dimeric full-length TMEM106B. Increased TMEM106B core deposition was also associated with enhanced TDP-43 dysfunction, and interactome data suggested a role for TMEM106B core filaments in impaired RNA transport, local translation, and endolysosomal function in FTLD-TDP.

Methods: Participants were randomized in the 3-year Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) to one of the three groups: lifestyle intervention, metformin, or placebo, and were subsequently followed in the DPP Outcomes Study. A 6MWT was conducted 20 years after randomization. Associations between DPP interventions and 6MWT completion (achieving a distance ≥200 m) were assessed using logistic regression. Among the test completers, differences in distance walked (6MWD) were evaluated using multivariable linear regression. Additional variables of interest included concomitant measures of body mass index (BMI) and grip strength along with mean measures of HbA1c and self-reported physical activity (PA). Results: Data on 1830 participants were analyzed.

Cognitive decline in normal aging, without neurodegenerative diseases, is strongly linked to myelin pathology.

However, changes in lipid composition during brain aging remain poorly understood. This study assessed lipid profiles from the frontal lobe corpus callosum, an area where age-related myelin pathology is linked to cognitive decline. Results showed significant changes in lipids with age, revealing distinct age-related profiles. Some lipids that are enriched in myelin sheaths become more saturated, while important structural components, like ceramides, decrease. Disease-associated biomarkers such as cholesterol ester Che (22:6) and sulfatide ST (42:2) also change in older monkeys. Additionally, gene expression of lipid biosynthetic enzymes declines with age, while lipid peroxidation remains stable in the same brain region. This suggests that changes in lipid biosynthesis, rather than oxidative damage, likely account for the differences in lipid composition.

These Antarctic Ca-Cl brines have extremely low freezing points, which leads to moist soil conditions that persist unfrozen and resist evaporation, even in cold, arid conditions. Several hypotheses exist to explain these unusual excess-calcium solutions, including salt deliquescence and differential salt mobility and cation exchange. Although the cation exchange mechanism was shown to explain the chemistry of pore waters in permafrost cores from several meters depth, it has not been evaluated for near-surface groundwater and wetland features (water tracks) in which excess-calcium pore-water solutions are common. Here, we use soluble salt and exchangeable cation concentrations to determine whether excess calcium is present in water-track brines and if cation exchange could be responsible for calcium enrichment in these cold desert groundwaters. We show that calcium enrichment by cation exchange is not occurring universally across the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Instead, evidence of the present-day formation of Ca-Cl–rich brines by cation exchange is focused in a geographically specific location in Taylor Valley, with hydrological position, microclimate, soil depth, and organic matter influencing the spatial extent of cation exchange reactions. Up-valley sites may be too cold and dry for widespread exchange, and warm and wet coastal sites are interpreted to host sediments whose exchange reactions have already gone to completion. We argue that exchangeable cation ratios can be used as a signature of past freeze-concentration of brines and exchange reactions, and thus could be considered a geochemical proxy for past groundwater presence in planetary permafrost settings. Correlations between water-track organic matter, fine sediment concentration, and cation exchange capacity suggest that water tracks may be sites of enhanced biogeochemical cycling in cold desert soils and serve as a model for predicting how active layers in the Antarctic will participate in biogeochemical cycling during periods of future thaw.",1,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,26499,OPP-1847067,0,FALSE,NA,NA,397,NA,NIA,National Institute on Aging,NA,NA

Here, we studied the RNA-binding protein FUS (fused in sarcoma), which has been implicated in muscular and neuromuscular pathologies but is poorly characterized in myogenesis. Given that FUS levels declined in human and mouse models of skeletal myogenesis, and that silencing FUS enhanced myogenesis, we hypothesized that FUS might be a repressor of myogenic differentiation. Interestingly, overexpression of FUS delayed myogenesis, accompanied by slower production of muscle differentiation markers. To identify the mechanisms through which FUS inhibits myogenesis, we uncovered RNA targets of FUS by ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation (RIP) followed by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Stringent selection of the bound transcripts uncovered Tnnt1 mRNA, encoding troponin T1 (TNNT1), as a major effector of FUS influence on myogenesis. We found that in myoblasts, FUS retained Tnnt1 mRNA in the nucleus, preventing TNNT1 expression; however, reduction of FUS during myogenesis or by silencing FUS released Tnnt1 mRNA for export to the cytoplasm, enabling TNNT1 translation and promoting myogenesis. We propose that FUS inhibits myogenesis by suppressing TNNT1 expression through a mechanism of nuclear Tnnt1 mRNA retention.",0,39133076,Journal,ar,Article,100,13,13,14150,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,401,Myogenesis | ribonucleoprotein complex | TNNT1 | translation,NA,NA,NA,NA

We examined these associations in adults aged ≥40 years using wrist actigraphy, and investigated whether these associations differed by sex and race. Methods: Participants were 468 cognitively normal adults aged ≥40 years enrolled in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging who completed wrist actigraphy. We used Generalized Least Squares Models to examine the associations of age with actigraphic sleep parameters, including total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, and wake after sleep onset (WASO). We conducted interaction and stratification analyses to test whether cross-sectional age-sleep associations were modified by sex and race. Results: In analyses adjusting for sex, body mass index, and individual medical conditions, older age was associated with longer TST from ages 40–70 that plateaued after age 70. Older age also was associated with lower sleep efficiency, longer sleep onset latency, and greater WASO. In men only, after age 70, older age was associated with shorter TST, lower sleep efficiency, longer onset latency, and greater WASO. However, we did not observe any significant interactions of race with age. Conclusions: Older age was associated with longer TST from ages 40 to 70 and with poorer sleep quality after age 40, and these relationships might vary by sex. Future studies with larger sample sizes are needed to investigate mechanisms that may account for sex differences in the observed age-sleep associations.",1,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,11,11,21101182141,R01 AG050507,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,402,actigraphy | aging | middle-aged adults | older adults | sleep,JHSPH,Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,zpae045,NA

It remains controversial whether dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia are distinct conditions or represent part of a disease spectrum. The biological mechanisms underlying disease heterogeneity, in particular the development of dementia, remain poorly understood, but will likely be the key to understanding disease pathways and, ultimately, therapy development. Previous genome-wide association studies in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies/Parkinson's disease dementia have identified risk loci differentiating patients from controls.

Cholinergic deficit is associated with pathophysiology in Alzheimer's disease, albeit the aetiology remains to be clarified. In the current study, neocortex cerebral blood flow response to acetylcholine was evaluated by Laser-Doppler Flowmetry (LDF) in 3xTgAD Alzheimer's disease model) and wild-Type mice of two age groups. The peak of cerebral blood flow to acetylcholine (i.v.) from baseline levels (% ΔrCBF) was higher in young 3xTgAD versus in wild-Type mice (48.35; 95% CI:27.03-69.67 versus 22.70; CI:15.5-29.91, P < 0.05); this was reversed in old 3xTgAD mice (21.44; CI:2.52-40.35 versus 23.25; CI:23.25-39). Choline acetyltransferase protein was reduced in neocortex, while cerebrovascular reactivity to acetylcholine was preserved in young 3×TgAD mice. This suggests endogenous acetylcholine deficit and possible cholinergic denervation from selected cholinergic nuclei within the basal forebrain. The early deposition of tauopathy moieties (mutant hTau and pTau181) and its coincidence in cholinergic cell clusters (occasionaly), were observed at the basal forebrain of 3xTgAD mice including substantia innominate, nucleus Basalis of Meynert and nucleus of horizontal limb diagonal band of Broca. A prominent feature was microglia interacting tauopathy and demonstrated a variety of morphology changes particularly when located in proximity to tauopathy. The microglia ramified phenotype was reduced as evaluated by the ramification index and Fractal analysis. Increased microglia senescence, identified as SASP (senescence-Associated secretory phenotype), was colocalization with p16Ink4α, a marker of irreversible cell-cycle arrest in old 3xTgAD versus wild-Type mice (P = 0.001). The p16Ink4α was also observed in neuronal cells bearing tauopathy within the basal forebrain of 3xTgAD mice. TNF-α, the pro-inflammatory cytokine elevated persistently in microglia (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.62) and the loss of cholinergic cells in vulnerable basal forebrain environment, was indicated by image analysis in 3xTgAD mice, which linked to the cholinergic deficits in neocortex rCBF haemodynamics. Our study revealed the early change of CBF haemodynamics to acetylcholine in 3xTgAD model. As a major effector of brain innate immune activation, microglia SASP with age-related disease progression is indicative of immune cell senescence, which contributes to chronic inflammation and cholinergic deficits at the basal forebrain.

Here, we characterized the proteomic landscape of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) changes associated with Aβ and tau pathology in 300 individuals using two different proteomic technologies—tandem mass tag mass spectrometry and SomaScan. Integration of both data types allowed for generation of a robust protein coexpression network consisting of 34 modules derived from 5242 protein measurements, including disease-relevant modules associated with autophagy, ubiquitination, endocytosis, and glycolysis. Three modules strongly associated with the apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) AD risk genotype mapped to oxidant detoxification, mitogen-associated protein kinase signaling, neddylation, and mitochondrial biology and overlapped with a previously described lipoprotein module in serum.

Objective: To evaluate the association of solar radiation with depression and distress among residents living in U.S. Gulf states. Methods: We enrolled home-visit participants in the Gulf Long-Term Follow-up Study who completed validated screening questionnaires for depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, N = 10,217) and distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Questionnaire, N = 8,765) for the previous 2 weeks.

Average solar radiation exposures in the seven (SRAD7), 14 (SRAD14), and 30 days (SRAD30) before the home visit were calculated and categorized into quartiles (Q1-Q4). We used generalized linear mixed models to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between solar radiation and depression/distress. Results: Higher levels of SRAD7 were non-monotonically inversely associated with depression [PRVs.Q1 (95%CI): Q2 = 0.81 (0.68, 0.97), Q3 = 0.80 (0.65, 0.99), Q4 = 0.88 (0.69, 1.15)] and distress [PRVs.Q1 (95%CI): Q2 = 0.76 (0.58, 0.99), Q3 = 0.77 (0.57, 1.06), Q4 = 0.84 (0.58, 1.22)].

Results: Results showed that purpose in life was negatively associated with functional difficulty, indicating fewer difficulties in mobility and daily activities among those with a high sense of purpose. While the association did not remain significant after including previous functional difficulty as a covariate in Model 4, suggesting that race may not be a consistent moderator, poverty status remained a consistent moderator.

The current study aimed to investigate the benefits of RG in alleviating hepatic cellular senescence and its adverse effects in 19-month-old aged mice. We applied two different intervention methods and durations to compare RG’s effects in a time-dependent manner: (1) oral gavage injection for 4 weeks and (2) ad libitum intervention for 14 weeks. We observed that 4-week RG administration was exerted to maintain insulin homeostasis against developing age-associated insulin insensitivity and suppressed cellular senescence pathway in the liver and primary hepatocytes. Moreover, with remarkable improvement of insulin homeostasis, 14-week RG supplementation downregulated the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and its downstream transcriptional factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in aged mice. Lastly, RG treatment significantly reduced the senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal)-positive cells in primary hepatocytes and ionizing radiation (IR)-exposed mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).

In this cross-sectional study, data on 635 cognitively normal participants from the UK Biobank study (2006-21, age range: 40-70 years) were used to examine whether H. pylori seropositivity (e.g. presence of antibodies), serointensities of five H. pylori antigens and a measure of total persistent infection burden were associated with selected brain volumetric structural MRI (total, white, grey matter, frontal grey matter (left/right), white matter hyperintensity as percent intracranial volume and bi-lateral sub-cortical volumes) and diffusion-weighted MRI measures (global and tract-specific bi-lateral fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity), after an average 9-10 years of lag time. Persistent infection burden was calculated as a cumulative score of seropositivity for over 20 different pathogens. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression analyses were conducted, whereby selected potential confounders (all measures) and intracranial volume (sub-cortical volumes) were adjusted, with stratification by Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk score tertile when exposures were H. pylori antigen serointensities. Type I error was adjusted to 0.007. We report little evidence of an association between H. pylori seropositivity and persistent infection burden with various volumetric outcomes (P > 0.007, from multivariable regression models), unlike previously reported in past research. However, H. pylori antigen serointensities, particularly immunoglobulin G against the vacuolating cytotoxin A, GroEL and outer membrane protein antigens, were associated with poorer tract-specific white matter integrity (P < 0.007), with outer membrane protein serointensity linked to worse outcomes in cognition-related tracts such as the external capsule, the anterior limb of the internal capsule and the cingulum, specifically at low Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk. Vacuolating cytotoxin A serointensity was associated with greater white matter hyperintensity volume among individuals with mid-level Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk, while among individuals with the highest Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk, the urease serointensity was consistently associated with reduced bi-lateral caudate volumes and the vacuolating cytotoxin A serointensity was linked to reduced right putamen volume (P < 0.007). Outer membrane protein and urease were associated with larger sub-cortical volumes (e.g. left putamen and right nucleus accumbens) at middle Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk levels (P < 0.007).

Cellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) is an early event following TBI. ROS often damage DNA, lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates while RNS attack proteins. The products of lipid peroxidation 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and protein nitration 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) are often used as indicators of oxidative and nitrosative damages, respectively. Increasing evidence has shown that striatum is vulnerable to damage from TBI with a disturbed dopamine neurotransmission. TBI results in neurodegeneration, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, neuronal apoptosis, and autophagy in the striatum and contribute to motor or behavioral deficits. Pomalidomide (Pom) is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved immunomodulatory drug clinically used in treating multiple myeloma. We previously showed that Pom reduces neuroinflammation and neuronal death induced by TBI in rat cerebral cortex. Here, we further compared the effects of Pom in cortex and striatum focusing on neurodegeneration, oxidative and nitrosative damages, as well as neuroinflammation following TBI. Sprague–Dawley rats subjected to a controlled cortical impact were used as the animal model of TBI. Systemic administration of Pom (0.5 mg/kg, intravenous [i.v.]) at 5 h post-injury alleviated motor behavioral deficits, contusion volume at 24 h after TBI. Pom alleviated TBI-induced neurodegeneration stained by Fluoro-Jade C in both cortex and striatum. Notably, Pom treatment reduces oxidative and nitrosative damages in cortex and striatum and is more efficacious in striatum (93% reduction in 4-HNE-positive and 84% reduction in 3-NT-positive neurons) than in cerebral cortex (42% reduction in 4-HNE-positive and 55% reduction in 3-NT-positive neurons).

However, the utility of such data for the prediction of time-to-event is unknown, and only a fraction of the data is typically used for risk prediction. We hypothesized that multimodal longitudinal imaging data could improve dynamic disease prognosis of cardiovascular and renal disease (CVRD). Methods: In a multi-centered cohort of 5,114 CARDIA participants, we included 166 longitudinal imaging variables from five imaging modalities: Echocardiography (Echo), Cardiac and Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT), Dual-Energy x-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA), Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) collected from young adulthood to mid-life over 30 years (1985–2016) to perform dynamic survival analysis of CVRD events using machine learning dynamic survival analysis (Dynamic-DeepHit, LTRCforest, and Extended Cox for Time-varying Covariates). Risk probabilities were continuously updated as new data were collected. Model performance was assessed using integrated AUC and C-index and compared to traditional risk factors. Results: Longitudinal imaging data, even when being irregularly collected with high missing rates, improved CVRD dynamic prediction (0.03 in integrated AUC, up to 0.05 in C-index compared to traditional risk factors; best model's C-index = 0.80–0.83 up to 20 years from baseline) from young adulthood followed up to midlife. Among imaging variables, Echo and CT variables contributed significantly to improved risk estimation. Echo measured in early adulthood predicted midlife CVRD risks almost as well as Echo measured 10–15 years later (0.01 C-index difference). The most recent CT exam provided the most accurate prediction for short-term risk estimation. Brain MRI markers provided additional information from cardiac Echo and CT variables that led to a slightly improved prediction. Conclusions: Longitudinal multimodal imaging data readily collected from follow-up exams can improve CVRD dynamic prediction.

A common practice to model the measured DW-MRI signal is via fiber orientation distribution function (fODF). This function is the essential first step for the downstream tractography and connectivity analyses. With recent advantages in data sharing, large-scale multisite DW-MRI datasets are being made available for multisite studies. However, measurement variabilities (e.g., inter- and intrasite variability, hardware performance, and sequence design) are inevitable during the acquisition of DW-MRI. Most existing model-based methods [e.g., constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)] and learning-based methods (e.g., deep learning) do not explicitly consider such variabilities in fODF modeling, which consequently leads to inferior performance on multisite and/or longitudinal diffusion studies. Approach: In this paper, we propose a data-driven deep CSD method to explicitly constrain the scan–rescan variabilities for a more reproducible and robust estimation of brain microstructure from repeated DW-MRI scans. Specifically, the proposed method introduces a three-dimensional volumetric scanner-invariant regularization scheme during the fODF estimation. We study the Human Connectome Project (HCP) young adults test–retest group as well as the MASiVar dataset (with inter- and intrasite scan/rescan data). The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging dataset is employed for external validation. Results: From the experimental results, the proposed data-driven framework outperforms the existing benchmarks in repeated fODF estimation. By introducing the contrastive loss with scan/rescan data, the proposed method achieved a higher consistency while maintaining higher angular correlation coefficients with the CSD modeling. The proposed method is assessing the downstream connectivity analysis and shows increased performance in distinguishing subjects with different biomarkers. Conclusion: We propose a deep CSD method to explicitly reduce the scan–rescan variabilities, so as to model a more reproducible and robust brain microstructure from repeated DW-MRI scans. The plug-and-play design of the proposed approach is potentially applicable to a wider range of data harmonization problems in neuroimaging.",3,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,14,14,21100829270,1452485,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,424,deep learning | diffusion magnetic resonance imaging | modeling,NSF,National Science Foundation,014005,NA

Our aim was to evaluate the longitudinal variation of muscle area, muscle quality, and muscle strength, relative to the variation of leukocyte-derived markers, and to assess the presence of a pathway of associations among derived leukocyte ratios, and the components of muscle health. The InCHIANTI is a longitudinal cohort study of aging that began in 1998 with follow-up visits every 3 years. Out of the 1 453 participants enrolled at baseline, this study includes 1 179 participants with complete data. Muscle strength was assessed by hand grip strength test, whereas muscle density and fat area were considered as indirect markers of muscle quality, derived from peripheral quantitative computed tomography of the calf. Muscle area was associated with neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NL-ratio), age, gender, comorbidities, and body mass index (BMI). Muscle density variation over time was inversely associated with age, comorbidities, and BMI, while being positively associated with monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (ML-ratio) and male gender. Fat area was inversely associated with age, interleukine-6 (IL-6), male gender, and NL-ratio, while being positively associated with ML-ratio, comorbidities, and BMI. Handgrip strength decreased with age, IL-6 levels, comorbidities, and NL-ratio, but increased with ML-ratio, being male, and having a higher BMI. In a path-analysis model, ML-ratio positively correlates with muscle mass, density, and strength, while NL-ratio only correlates inversely with muscle mass and density. NL-ratio and ML-ratio are associated with aging and may be implicated in age-related mechanisms that affect body composition and muscle strength. These ratios may represent a link between aging of the immune system and decline of muscle health with aging.

LRRK2 protein is highly expressed in the human brain and also in the periphery, and high expression of dominant PD genes in immune cells suggests involvement of microglia and macrophages in inflammation related to PD. LRRK2 is known to respond to extracellular signalling including TLR4, resulting in alterations in gene expression, with the response to TLR2 signalling through zymosan being less known. Here, we investigated the effects of zymosan, a TLR2 agonist and the potent and specific LRRK2 kinase inhibitor MLi-2 on gene expression in microglia from LRRK2-WT and LRRK2 p.G2019S knock-in mice by RNA-sequencing analysis. We observed both overlapping and distinct zymosan and MLi-2 mediated gene expression profiles in microglia. At least two candidate genome-wide association (GWAS) hits for PD, CathepsinB (Ctsb) and Glycoprotein-nmb (Gpnmb), were notably downregulated by zymosan treatment. Genes involved in inflammatory response and nervous system development were up and downregulated, respectively, with zymosan treatment, while MLi-2 treatment particularly exhibited upregulated genes for ion transmembrane transport regulation. Furthermore, we observed that the top twenty most significantly differentially expressed genes in LRRK2 p.G2019S microglia show enriched biological processes in iron transport and response to oxidative stress.

G4 resolvases are often represented by a class of molecular motors known as helicases that disrupt the Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds in G4 by harnessing the chemical energy of nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis. Of special interest to researchers in the field, including us, is the human FANCJ DNA helicase that efficiently resolves G4 DNA structures. Notably, FANCJ mutations are linked to Fanconi Anemia and are prominent in breast and ovarian cancer.

In addition to its G4 resolvase function, FANCJ is also a classic DNA helicase that acts on conventional duplex DNA structures, which are relevant to the enzyme's role in interstrand cross link repair, double-strand break repair via homologous recombination, and response to replication stress.

Powerful, clinically applicable tools are required to enable mechanistic stratification for future precision medicine approaches. The aim of this study was to characterize bioenergetic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease by applying a multimodal approach, combining standardized clinical assessment with midbrain and putaminal 31-phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) and deep phenotyping of mitochondrial and lysosomal function in peripheral tissue in patients with recent-onset Parkinson's disease and control subjects. Sixty participants (35 patients with Parkinson's disease and 25 healthy controls) underwent 31P-MRS for quantification of energy-rich metabolites [ATP, inorganic phosphate (Pi) and phosphocreatine] in putamen and midbrain. In parallel, skin biopsies were obtained from all research participants to establish fibroblast cell lines for subsequent quantification of total intracellular ATP and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) as well as mitochondrial and lysosomal morphology, using high content live cell imaging. Lower MMP correlated with higher intracellular ATP (r = -0.55, P = 0.0016), higher mitochondrial counts (r = -0.72, P < 0.0001) and higher lysosomal counts (r = -0.62, P = 0.0002) in Parkinson's disease patient-derived fibroblasts only, consistent with impaired mitophagy and mitochondrial uncoupling. 31P-MRS-derived posterior putaminal Pi/ATP ratio variance was considerably greater in Parkinson's disease than in healthy controls (F-tests, P = 0.0036). Furthermore, elevated 31P-MRS-derived putaminal, but not midbrain Pi/ATP ratios (indicative of impaired oxidative phosphorylation) correlated with both greater mitochondrial (r = 0.37, P = 0.0319) and lysosomal counts (r = 0.48, P = 0.0044) as well as lower MMP in both short (r = -0.52, P = 0.0016) and long (r = -0.47, P = 0.0052) mitochondria in Parkinson's disease.

Results: Overall, results were comparable across all data sets. Different physiological systems showed distinct dysregulation processes. Association with age was moderate and often nonlinear, similarly for all populations. Mahalanobis distance predicted most health outcomes, although differently by physiological system. Using a Chinese population as the reference when calculating DM for Western populations, or vice versa, led to similar associations with health outcomes, with a few exceptions. Conclusions: While small differences were noticeable, they did not systematically emerge between Chinese and Western populations, but rather diffusively across all data sets.

We calculated changes in BP from the supine to the standing position at 5 measurements taken within 2 minutes after standing during the baseline visit (1987-1989). The primary outcome was adjudicated dementia ascertained through 2019. RESULTS: Among 11 644 participants (mean [SD] age, 54.5 [5.7] years; 54.1% women; 25.9% Black), 2303 dementia cases were identified during a median follow-up of 25.9 years. Large decreases in systolic BP from the supine to standing position measured at the first 2 measurements ≈30 and 50 seconds after standing, but not afterward, were associated with orthostatic dizziness and a higher risk of dementia. Comparing a decrease in systolic BP of ≤-20 or >-20 to -10 mm Hg to stable systolic BP (>-10 to 10 mm Hg) at the first measurement, the adjusted hazard ratios were 1.22 (95% CI, 1.01-1.47) and 1.10 (95% CI, 0.97-1.25), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal orthostatic BP regulation, especially abrupt drops in BP within the first minute, might be early risk markers for the development of dementia.

Methods: Among 38,803 UK Biobank adults (Age:40–70 years), we tested associations of total IB (IBtotal, 47.5 %) and hospital-treated IB (IBhosp, 9.7 %) with NODDI measures (5–15 years later), including volume fraction of Gaussian isotropic diffusion (ISOVF), intra-cellular volume fraction (ICVF) and orientation dispersion (OD) indices, using multiple linear regression models. Results: Total and hospital-treated infection burdens (IBtotal and IBhosp) were associated with increased ISOVF, indicating increased free-water component. IBtotal was positively associated with OD, indicating that at higher IBtotal there was greater fanning of neurites. This was more evident in the lower cardiovascular health group. IBhosp was associated with higher OD, and lower ICVF at higher AD polygenic risk. Together, these findings indicate that both total and hospital-treated infections have effects on NODDI outcomes in the direction of poor brain health. These effects were largely homogeneous across cardiovascular health and AD polygenic risk groups, with some effects shown to be stronger at poor cardiovascular health and/or higher AD risk. Conclusions: Total and hospital-treated infections were associated with poorer white matter microstructure (higher ISOVF or OD or lower ICVF), with some heterogeneity across cardiovascular health and AD risk.

However, the longitudinal characteristics of frailty components in post-hip fracture patients are less understood. Adopting the Fried frailty definition, we examined the longitudinal trends and sex trajectory differences in frailty and its components over 1 year post-fracture. Methods: Three hundred and twenty-seven hip fracture patients (162 men and 165 women with mean age 80.1 and 81.5) from Baltimore Hip Studies 7th cohort with measurements at 22 days after admission, and months 2, 6, and 12 post-fracture were analyzed. Frailty components included: grip strength, gait speed, weight, total energy expenditure, and exhaustion. Longitudinal analysis used mixed effect models. Results: At baseline, men were sicker with worse cognitive status, and had higher weight and grip strength, but lower total energy expenditure than women (p < 0.001). The prevalence of frailty was 31.5%, 30.2%, and 28.2% at months 2, 6, and 12 respectively, showing no longitudinal trends or sex differences. However, its components showed substantial recovery trends over the post-fracture year after confounding adjustments, including increasing gait speed, reducing risk of exhaustion, and stabilized weight loss and energy expenditure over time. Particularly, while men's grip strength tended to remain stable over first year post surgery within patients, women's grip strength reduced significantly over time within patients. On average over time within patients, women were more active with higher energy expenditures but lower grip strength and weight than men. Conclusion: Significant recovery trends and sex differences were observed in frailty components during first year post-fracture. Overall frailty status did not show those trends over months 2–12 since a summary measure might obscure changes in components. Therefore, frailty components provided important multi-dimensional information on the complex recovery process of patients, indicating targets for intervention beyond the global binary measure of frailty.",2,37725439,Journal,ar,Article,100,8,8,28514,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,446,frailty | gait speed | grip strength | post hip fracture | total energy expenditure,NIA,National Institute on Aging,NA,NA

Cross-sectional multivariable regression analyses examined interactive associations of religious coping, race, and sex to TL, adjusting for other sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Religious coping was unrelated to TL in this sample (p’s >.05). There were no notable race or sex differences. Post hoc exploratory analyses similarly found that neither secular social support coping use nor substance use coping was associated with TL. Conclusion: There was no evidence to support that religious coping use provided protective effects to TL in this sample of African American and White women and men.
