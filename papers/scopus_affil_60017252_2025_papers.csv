The structure of wild-type (WT) alleles includes a prominent architectural stripe that extends from a cluster of CTCF binding elements at the 3′ end of the locus (3′CBE), suggesting interactions of this end with sequences throughout the 2 Mb Igh TAD. Here we elucidate interplay between regulatory elements located in the 3′Igh domain (260 kb) that impact the stripe. The CTCF-lacking intronic enhancer, Eµ, promotes stripe formation and tethers sub-TADs between flanking CTCF-bound 3′CBE and IGCR1. Substituting Eµ with an EF1α promoter in different orientations partially recapitulates epigenetic features of WT Igh alleles, including active histone modifications, sub-TAD formation and interactions with the 3′CBE, but does not restore VDJ recombination. Loss of IGCR1 increases the stripe while inverting the 3′CBE redirects the stripe away from the Igh locus. However, inverted 3′CBE continue to serve as a boundary against aberrant activation of genes outside the Igh domain by Eµ.

While regulatory T-cell dysfunction remains central to CTLA4-D immunopathogenesis, mechanisms driving disease severity and intestinal pathology are unknown but likely involve intestinal dysbiosis. We determined whether the intestinal microbiome and metabolome could distinguish individuals with severe CTLA4-D and identify biomarkers of disease severity. Results: The genera Veillonella and Streptococcus emerged as biomarkers that distinguished CTLA4-D from healthy cohorts from both the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center, USA (NIH; CTLA-D, n = 32; healthy controls, n = 16), and a geographically distinct cohort from the Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency (CCI) of the Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Germany (CCI; CTLA4-D, n = 25; healthy controls, n = 24). Since IEIs in general may be associated with perturbations of the microbiota, a disease control cohort of individuals with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID, n = 20) was included to evaluate for a CTLA4-D-specific microbial signature. Despite common IEI-associated microbiome changes, the two bacterial genera retained their specificity as biomarkers for CTLA4-D. We further identified intestinal microbiome and metabolomic signatures that distinguished patients with CTLA4-D having severe vs. mild disease. Microbiome changes were associated with distinct stool metabolomic profiles and predicted changes in metabolic pathways. These differences were impacted by the presence of gastrointestinal manifestations and were partially reversed by treatment with abatacept and/or sirolimus. Conclusions: Loss of intestinal microbial diversity and dysbiosis causing metabolomic changes was observed in CTLA4-D. Albeit some of these features were shared with CVID, the distinct changes associated with CTLA4-D highlight the fact that IEI-associated microbiome changes likely reflect the underlying immune dysregulation. Identified candidate intestinal microbial and metabolic biomarkers distinguishing individuals with CTLA4-D based on severity should be studied prospectively to determine their predictive value, and investigated as potential therapeutic ta. 5D3rs3jgvo7MqmP_TFVE2KVideo Abstract",2,39934899,Journal,ar,Article,100,20,20,51,21100401152,ULg,480707,Université de Liège,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,5,Autoimmunity | Common variable immunodeficiency | CTLA4 deficiency | Disease severity | Dysbiosis | Gastrointestinal inflammation | Immune dysregulation | Immunomodulator | Inborn error of immunity | Metabolome | Microbiome,NA,NA,NA

Here, we characterize a variable number tandem repeat within TERT intron 6, VNTR6-1 (38-bp repeat unit), and detect a strong link between VNTR6-1 alleles (Short: 24-27 repeats, Long: 40.5-66.5 repeats) and GWAS signals rs2242652 and rs10069690 within TERT intron 4. Bioinformatics analyses reveal that rs10069690-T allele increases intron 4 retention while VNTR6-1-Long allele expands a polymorphic G-quadruplex (G4, 35-113 copies) within intron 6, with both variants contributing to variable TERT expression through alternative splicing and nonsense-mediated decay. In two cell lines, CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of VNTR6-1 increases the ratio of TERT-full-length (FL) to the alternative TERT-β isoform, promoting apoptosis and reducing cell proliferation. In contrast, treatment with G4-stabilizing ligands shifts splicing from TERT-FL to TERT-β isoform, implicating VNTR6-1 as a splicing switch. We associate the functional variants VNTR6-1, rs10069690, and their haplotypes with multi-cancer risk and age-related telomere shortening.

We previously showed that ROS up-regulate miR-200c expression, that in turns causes apoptosis, senescence, ROS upregulation and nitric oxide decrease, leading to endothelial disfunction. Methods: The aim of this study is to dissect miR-200c role in DFU and to explore the potential role of anti-miR-200c and antioxidant catalase (CAT) in promoting wound healing (WH). miR-200c inhibition and CAT treatment were performed either in immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) or in primary fibroblasts (FBs) and keratinocytes (KCs) deriving from diabetic patients (pts) undergoing amputations. Primary cells deriving from pts undergoing saphenectomies were used as controls. The miR-200c blockade was performed either via lentiviral particles bearing an anti-miR-200c sequence or locked nucleic acid (LNA) anti-miR-200c oligos. Equine CAT was administered on cell medium. The WH assay was performed in vivo on diabetic (db/db) mice by a topical treatment with CAT and LNA anti-miR-200c on wounds dissolved in a Pluronic gel mixture, administered every three days. Results: We found that miR-200c levels were increased by different stimuli known to induce ROS, such as ultraviolet radiation (UV), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and high glucose in HaCaT. miR-200c was also upregulated in skin biopsies, in FBs and KCs isolated from pts with DFU vs controls. Forced miR-200c expression induced ROS in both FBs and KCs, and CAT reduced it. miR-200c inhibition improved WH in HaCaT, both under basal conditions and after UV and H2O2 treatment, and the simultaneous treatment with CAT accelerated it. miR-200c inhibition accelerated WH in KCs of DFU pts, increasing its protein targets: sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), the transcription factors FOXO1 and ZEB1 and decreasing p66Shc phosphorylation at Ser-36, that is induced by ROS, and the co-treatment with CAT showed synergistic effects in reducing ROS and cytotoxicity. Interestingly, CAT treatment decreased miR-200c expression in FBs and KCs of DFU pts. Topical administration of anti-miR-200c and CAT in a WH model of diabetic mice accelerated closure.

This has propelled us to develop the GIANT (Genetically Informed brAiN aTlas) that accounts for genetic and neuroanatomical variations simultaneously. Integrating voxel-wise heritability and spatial proximity, GIANT clusters brain voxels into genetically informed regions, while retaining fundamental anatomical knowledge. Compared to conventional (non-genetics) brain atlases, GIANT exhibits smaller intra-region variations and larger inter-region variations in terms of voxel-wise heritability. As a result, GIANT yields increased regional SNP heritability, enhanced polygenicity, and its polygenic risk score explains more brain volumetric variation than traditional neuroanatomical brain atlases. We provide extensive validation to GIANT and demonstrate its neuroanatomical validity, confirming its generalizability across populations with diverse genetic ancestries and various brain conditions. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive genetic architecture of the GIANT regions, covering their functional annotation at the molecular levels, their associations with other complex traits/diseases, and the genetic and phenotypic correlations among GIANT-defined imaging endophenotypes.

The main physico-chemical and technological characteristics of the obtained vesicles, along with their stability over time were measured. The in vitro biocompatibility and ability of nutriosomes to protect intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2) from oxidative damages, were evaluated. Finally, the effectiveness of repeated administration of Cannonau extract in dispersion or loaded in nutriosomes against the neurotoxic effects in mice was evaluated. The resulting vesicles had uniform distribution, controlled the release of payloads, were biocompatible, like nutriosomes loading Nasco pomace extract, protected the intestinal cells against damages induced by hydrogen peroxide, in a better extent than the Nasco nutriosomes. However, no significant neuroprotective effects were observed in in vivo experiments performed using a subacute model of Parkinson disease, unlike previous results obtained with Nasco pomace extract loaded nutriosomes. This discrepancy is possibly due to the absence of key polyphenols like procyanidin B2 in the Cannonau extract, which are instead present in the Nasco extract.

However, there is limited research supporting this traditional practice and insufficient evidence demonstrating the molecular mechanisms of action of plant-derived bioactives in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The current study aims to identify the effective components in Drynaria quercifolia methanol rhizome extract (DME) and their probable pharmacological mechanisms in alleviating Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) using network-pharmacology, molecular docking, molecular-dynamics simulations, and gene expression-based validation. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based screening identified 41 volatile phytocomponents from DME having drug-like potentiality. Network pharmacology-based screening revealed 117 therapeutic targets for RA of which 11 have been identified as core targets. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis indicated that key target genes were mostly enriched in the inflammatory response associated with multiple signalling pathways. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies revealed that key target proteins like serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), exhibited strong binding affinity and stable interactions with multiple phytocomponents present in DME. For experimental verification FCA (Freund’s complete adjuvant)-induced chronic arthritis model employed for further molecular investigation. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) results validated that DME significantly (p ≤ 0.05) regulate the expression of key identified target genes AKT and PPARG in experimental RA model. Moreover, this study further confirmed that DME significantly (p ≤ 0.05) downregulated pro-inflammatory mediators like COX-2, IL-6 and TNF-α at gene and protein levels and also normalized (p ≤ 0.05) different oxidative stress parameters in both the low and high dose groups of DME-treated arthritic animals. In conclusion, the network-based in silico approach indicated that the phytocomponents present in DME probably act in a synergistic way to modulate key identified targets associated with RA, which was further validated by experimental studies. Therefore, DME could be a potential alternative in immunomodulatory therapies to combat RA and related chronic inflammatory conditions.",0,40199969,Journal,ar,Article,100,10,10,11981,21100200805,CSIR,259/R-2018,"Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India",1,TRUE,NA,NA,18,Cytokine | Drynaria Quercifolia | Gene expression | Inflammation | Molecular docking | Network pharmacology | Rheumatoid arthritis,NA,NA,NA

Innovations in the collection and modelling of passive data from personally-owned smartphones (e.g., GPS), called digital phenotyping, may afford the possibility of remotely monitoring and detecting distress and burden. We explored the potential of using passively-collected GPS data from smartphones to assess and predict caregiver and patient distress and burden. Methods: This exploratory longitudinal cohort study enrolled smartphone-owning family caregiver and patient participants with advanced cancer (August 2021-July 2023) recruited via an oncology clinic or self-referral through Facebook. Participants downloaded a digital phenotyping research app, called Beiwe, that passively collected GPS data for 24 weeks. Participants completed self-report measures (PROs) of anxiety and depressive symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]), mental health (PROMIS Mental Health), and caregiver burden (Montgomery-Borgatta Caregiver Burden scale) at baseline and every 6 weeks for 24 weeks. After pre-processing raw GPS data into daily GPS features (e.g., time spent at home, distance traveled/day), computing biweekly moving averages and standard deviations, and conducting a principal components analysis (PCA) of the resulting variables, within-person regression models were used to assess associations between changes in PRO measures and changes in PCA scores, with adjusted-R2 as the measure of effect size (small = 0.02, medium = 0.13, large = 0.26). Results: Evaluable data were collected from 48 participants (family caregivers = 32; patients = 16). Caregiver smartphone data explained small-to-medium variance in caregiver anxiety (0.06), depression (0.15), and mental health (0.07). Patient smartphone data predicted small to medium variance in caregiver depressive symptoms (0.12) and burden (0.05). Combined caregiver and patient smartphone data explained small variance in caregiver depressive (0.02) and anxiety symptoms (0.10) and large variance for PROMIS-mental health (0.36) and burden (0.50). For patient outcomes, caregiver smartphone data accounted for small variance in anxiety symptoms (0.07); patient smartphone data predicted large variance in anxiety symptoms (0.24).

Kremen1+ neurons displayed delayed activation at locomotion onset but exhibited increasing activity during locomotion offset. In contrast, Calb1+ neurons showed early activation at locomotion onset and decreasing activity during locomotion offset. Optogenetic activation of Kremen1+ neurons suppressed ongoing locomotion, whereas activation of Calb1+ neurons promoted locomotion. Activation of Kremen1+ neurons induced a greater reduction in dopamine release than Calb1+ neurons, followed by a post-stimulation rebound. Conversely, activation of Calb1+ neurons triggered an initial increase in dopamine release. Furthermore, genetic knockdown of GABA-B receptor Gabbr1 in Aldh1a1+ nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons (DANs) reduced DAN inhibition and completely abolished the locomotion-suppressing effect of Kremen1+ neurons.

APOE allele variants that encode proteins differing only in the number of cysteine (Cys)-to-arginine (Arg) exchanges (ApoE2 [2 Cys], ApoE3 [1 Cys], ApoE4 [0 Cys]) comprise the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the specific molecular feature(s) and resultant mechanisms that underlie these isoform-dependent effects are unknown. One signature feature of Cys is the capacity to form disulfide (Cys-Cys) bridges, which are required to form disulfide-linked dimers and multimers. Here we propose the overarching hypothesis that super-ability (for ApoE2), intermediate ability (for ApoE3) or inability (for ApoE4) to form lipid-protecting intermolecular disulfide bridges, is the central molecular determinant accounting for the disparate effects of APOE alleles on AD risk and amyloid-β and Tau pathologies in humans. We posit that presence and abundance of Cys in human ApoE3 and ApoE2 respectively, conceal and protect vulnerable lipids transported by ApoE from peroxidation by enabling formation of disulfide-linked homo- and heteromeric ApoE complexes. We thus propose that inability to form intermolecular disulfide bridges makes ApoE4-containing lipoproteins uniquely vulnerable to peroxidation and its downstream consequences. Consistent with our model, we found that brain-enriched polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids induce disulfide-dependent dimerization and multimerization of ApoE3 and ApoE2 (but not ApoE4). By contrast, incubation with the peroxidation-resistant lipid DMPC or cholesterol alone had minimal effects on dimerization.

This excludes an important transitional period from high to low circulating oestrogen. Using secondary data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, this study aimed to investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between circulating sex hormones and skeletal muscle mass and function across a continuum of ages. Methods: Multiple and binomial linear regression was used to map cross-sectional (n = 319) and longitudinal (n = 83) associations between circulating sex hormones (oestradiol (E2), free oestradiol index (FEI), total (TT) and bioavailable (BioT), testosterone, testosterone/oestradiol ratio (TT/E2)) and skeletal muscle mass and function in healthy females. Cross-sectional models analysed females across an ageing continuum (24–89 years) and longitudinal associations were tested across 4–6 years of ageing in females over 50 years old. Models were adjusted for age, height, physical activity, comorbidities, ethnicity, and follow-up time. Results: Cross-sectionally, serum E2 and FEI were positively associated with relative appendicular lean mass (ALM; β = 0.28 and 0.20, respectively, p < 0.05) and thigh muscle percentage (β = 0.19 and 0.15, respectively, p < 0.05). E2 and FEI were negatively associated with total body fat percentage (β = −0.30 and −0.21, respectively, p < 0.05). BioT was positively associated with absolute ALM (β = 0.13, p < 0.05) and total body fat percentage (β = 0.18, p < 0.05). TT was negatively associated with total body fat percentage (β = −0.14, p < 0.05). The TT/E2 ratio was negatively associated with thigh muscle CSA (β = −0.08, p < 0.05) and hamstring strength (β = −0.12, p < 0.05). Across 4–6 years, decreases in E2 and FEI were associated with a decrease in ALM (β = 0.27 and 0.41, respectively, p < 0.05), and a decrease in FEI was associated with a decrease in handgrip strength (β = 0.21, p < 0.05). Decreases in TT and BioT were associated with an increase in total body fat (β = −0.25 for both, p < 0.05) and a decrease in TT was associated with an increase in hamstring specific force (β = −0.11, p < 0.05).

Imbalance in CL metabolism, especially excessive CL oxidation, leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and inflammation, contributing to age-related diseases. As of yet no comprehensive methods have been developed to assess CL, oxidized CL (oxCL), and monolyso-CL (MLCL) species. Results: To fill this critical research gap, we combined untargeted and targeted lipidomic approaches to analyze CL species in human skeletal muscle samples. The method enabled in-depth structural characterization using exact mass measurement followed by multistage fragmentation (MSn) to achieve unequivocal structural elucidation at the molecular species level and sn-position level for some species. This novel methodology identified intact mono- and di-oxygenated L4CL species and allowed the differentiation of isomeric 9/13-HODE-L3CL and 9(10)/12(13)-EpOME-L3CL with unprocessed total lipid extracts. Overall, 220 molecular species (125 CL, 30 oxCL, and 65 MLCL) were detected. Our method includes a quantitation strategy that leveraged on establishing three-leveled matrix-matched calibration curves normalized by using internal standard M4CL and its isotopologues M+1 (13C-M4CL) and M+3 (13C3-M4CL) respectively. The analytical performance was also evaluated and found to be highly sensitive with LLOQs at fmol levels and reproducible with precision RSD <20 % for the majority. Significance and novelty: This is the first reported method to simultaneously provide broad coverage of CL, oxCL, and MLCL species from a single injection of total lipid extract in a complex biological sample. This method is also the first to demonstrate the presence of sn-positional isomers of CL in human skeletal muscle. It has been successfully applied to a pilot study of skeletal muscle biopsies and provided meaningful results.

Methods: This analysis of pooled participant data from large prospective cohort studies from the Thyroid Studies Collaboration assessed cvRFs (blood pressure [BP], lipid levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP]) among participants aged 18 to 103 years with SHypo (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] > 4.50 mU/L, normal fT4) and SHyper (TSH < 0.45 mU/L, normal fT4) vs euthyroid (TSH 0.45-4.50 mU/L).

In this Review, we consider how EV biomarkers can bring us closer to understanding the complex pathogenesis of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. We describe how translational research on EVs might unfold bidirectionally, proceeding from basic to clinical studies but also in the opposite direction, with biomarker findings in the clinic leading to novel hypotheses that can be tested in the laboratory. We demonstrate the potential value of EVs across all stages of the therapeutic development pipeline, from identifying therapeutic targets to the use of EVs as reporters in model systems and biomarkers in clinical research.

In particular, lipofuscin (LF) is an interfering pigment in multiplex fluorescence assays. Lipofuscin (LF) is a highly cross-linked aggregate of oxidized lipids, proteins, sugars, and metal ions that accumulates in lysosomes with age, and is strongly fluorescent across wavelengths that interfere with signals from common fluorophores. This is particularly apparent in dorsal root ganglion (DRG), where the LF deposits occupy up to 80% of the visible neuronal cytoplasm, affecting ∼45% of neurons in a typical section. This report describes a straightforward, scalable, pre-staining, white-light photobleaching method that near-totally reduces LF autofluorescence, and improves signal detection across the color spectrum without negatively impacting the multiplex fluorescence detection assay. It is effective for peripheral and central nervous system structures as well as pathological tissue such as Alzheimer's disease brain, which contains high levels of autofluorescent interference. This demonstrates the broad applicability to improving signal detection in human disease states to enable translational investigations in humans. This low-cost procedure can be rapidly implemented into existing research programs to increase the accessibility of high-plex fluorescent microscopy methodologies to enable direct-in-human research. Perspective: White light photobleaching of lipofuscin before multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization allows for rapid, near-total quenching of autofluorescence in healthy and diseased human nervous system tissue.

Traditionally, atrophy has been quantified by differences in brain volume or thickness over a specified timeframe. Research indicates that the rate of atrophy varies across different brain regions, which themselves exhibit complex spatial and hierarchical organizations. These characteristics collectively emphasize the need for diverse summary measures that can effectively capture the multidimensional nature of degeneration. In this study, we explore the use of distance measurements to quantify brain volumetric changes using processed MRI data from the Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease Consortium (PAC). We conducted a series of analyses to predict future diagnostic status by modeling MRI trajectories for participants who were cognitively normal at baseline and either remained cognitively normal or progressed to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) over time, with adjustments for age, sex, education, and APOE genotype. We consider multiple distance measures and brain regions through a two-step approach. First, we build base models by fitting individual mixed-effect models for each distance metric and brain region pairing, using follow-up diagnosis (normal vs. MCI) as the outcome and volumetric changes from the baseline, as summarized by a given distance measure, as predictors. The second step aggregates these individual region-distance base models to derive an overall estimate of diagnostic status. Our analyses showed that the distance measures approach consistently outperformed the traditional direct volumetric approach in terms of predictive accuracy, both in individual base models and the aggregated models.

This is particularly relevant for noncigarette products (eg, cigars, pipes, and smokeless tobacco), which have been understudied because of their low prevalence in individual cohorts. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 98 450 participants from the Cross-Cohort Collaboration–Tobacco data set. Associations between the use of tobacco products and subclinical markers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, fibrinogen, D-dimer, coronary artery calcium, carotid intima-media thickness, carotid plaque, and ankle-brachial index) were evaluated. The analyses used multivariable linear and logistic regression models to examine current use status for each product, with additional analyses of “sole” and “exclusive” noncigarette use (versus never use of either cigarettes or specific noncigarette tobacco). Sole use was defined as the current use of a given noncigarette tobacco without concurrent combustible cigarette use, whereas exclusive use was defined as current noncigarette tobacco use without any history of combustible cigarette use. RESULTS: A total of 20.0%, 3.0%, 0.8%, and 1.5% of participants were current cigarette, cigar, pipe, or smokeless tobacco users, respectively. Current cigarette use was linked to higher levels of all markers compared with never cigarette use. Compared with respective reference groups, current, sole, and exclusive cigar use was associated with 10% (95% CI, 1–20), 19% (95% CI, 12–26), and 11% (95% CI, 2–21) higher high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels on the geometric mean scale. Similar associations were noted for pipe and smokeless tobacco use. For interleukin-6, we observed that sole cigar use was associated with a 15% (95% CI, 6–24) higher level, whereas current, sole, and exclusive pipe use were associated with 22% to 32% (all P values <0.05) higher levels compared with their respective reference groups.

Here we conduct large-scale functional analyses of visual and olfactory receptors and related brain regions across extant primates. Our results reveal a visual shift from ultraviolet to violet colour sensitivity in early haplorrhine primates, followed by acceleration in the rhodopsin retinal release rates at the origin of anthropoids, both of which are expected to greatly enhance visual acuity under brighter light conditions. Additionally, we find that the sensitivity of olfactory receptors shifted from narrowly to broadly tuned early in anthropoid evolution. In contrast, strepsirrhines appear to have retained sensitive dim-light vision and underwent functional enhancement of narrowly tuned olfactory receptors. Our models indicate that this would have enhanced odorant discrimination and facilitated olfaction-mediated physiology and behaviour. These differences in tuning patterns of olfactory receptors between major primate lineages mirror well-established morphological differences in external anatomy and brain structures, revealing new mechanisms of olfactory adaptation and evolutionary plasticity.

RA was associated with an increased fracture risk in men and women, and these data will be used to update FRAX®. Introduction: RA is a well-documented risk factor for subsequent fracture that is incorporated into the FRAX algorithm. The aim of this study was to evaluate, in an international meta-analysis, the association between rheumatoid arthritis and subsequent fracture risk and its relation to sex, age, duration of follow-up, and bone mineral density (BMD) with a view to updating FRAX. Methods: The resource comprised 1,909,896 men and women, aged 20–116 years, from 29 prospective cohorts in which the prevalence of RA was 3% or less (primary analysis) and an additional 17 cohorts with a prevalence greater than 3% (supplementary analysis). The association between RA and fracture risk (any clinical fracture, osteoporotic fracture, major osteoporotic fracture (MOF), and hip fracture) was examined using an extension of the Poisson regression model in each cohort and each sex, followed by random-effects meta-analyses of the weighted beta coefficients. Results: In the primary analysis, RA was reported in 1.3% of individuals. During 15,683,133 person-years of follow-up, 139,002 fractures occurred, of which 27,518 were hip fractures. RA was associated with an increased risk of any clinical fracture (hazard ratio [HR] 1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35–1.65). The HRs were of similar magnitude for osteoporotic fracture and MOF but higher for hip fracture (HR = 2.23; 95% CI 1.85–2.69). For hip fracture, there was a significant interaction with age with higher HRs at younger ages. HRs did not differ between men and women and were independent of exposure to glucocorticoids and femoral neck BMD. Lower HRs were observed in the supplementary analysis cohorts, particularly in those with a high apparent prevalence of RA, possibly from conflation of RA with osteoarthritis. Conclusions: A diagnosis of RA confers an increased risk of fracture that is largely independent of BMD, sex, and corticosteroids.

Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: The RA cohort included 14,972 patients, with 4759 initiating JAKi. The UC cohort included 2085 patients, with 347 initiating JAKi. In the overall RA cohort, the weighted HR was 0.92 (95% CI 0.59–1.42) for 3P-MACE, 1.61 (1.08–2.41) for malignancy, and 1.08 (0.94–1.23) for serious infection. In the overall UC cohort, the weighted HR was 0.98 (0.11–8.42) and 0.45 (0.26–0.78) for malignancy and serious infection, respectively. No 3P-MACE cases were observed in JAKi users. Conclusions: JAKis were associated with an elevated risk of malignancy but no significant difference in the risk of 3P-MACE and serious infection among all patients with RA. Further data are needed regarding the risk of malignancy and 3P-MACE in patients with UC.",0,39868841,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,NA,26656,NRF,undefined,National Research Foundation of Korea,0,FALSE,NA,NA,55,drug safety | Janus kinase inhibitor | rheumatoid arthritis | tumor necrosis factor inhibitor | ulcerative colitis,09546820,NA,366-381

We previously identified a 7 megabases complex structural variant in a pair of monozygotic twins using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing. This study aims to determine if ONT long-read sequencing can detect a second variant in other unresolved early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) cases with 1 heterozygous PRKN or PINK1 variant. Methods: ONT long-read sequencing was performed on EOPD patients with 1 reported PRKN/PINK1 pathogenic variant, with onset age under 50. Positive controls included EOPD patients with 2 known PRKN pathogenic variants. Initial testing involved short-read targeted panel sequencing for single nucleotide variants and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for copy number variants. Results: A total of 47 patients were studied (PRKN “one-variant,” n = 23; PINK1 “one-variant,” n = 12; PRKN “two-variants,” n = 12). ONT long-read sequencing identified a second pathogenic variant in 26% of PRKN “one-variant” patients (6/23), but none in PINK1 “one-variant” patients (0/12). Detected variants included 1 complex inversion, 2 structural variant overlaps, and 3 duplications. In the PRKN “two-variants” group, both variants were identified in all patients (100%, 12/12). Interpretation: ONT long-read sequencing effectively identifies pathogenic structural variants in the PRKN locus missed by conventional methods. It should be considered for unresolved EOPD cases when a second variant is not detected through conventional approaches.

This study analyzed 437 longitudinal observations from 138 cognitively unimpaired adults, aged 22 to 94 years, to investigate the relationship between myelin content and changes in gait speed over an average of 6.42 years. Myelin content was quantified using a novel multicomponent magnetic resonance relaxometry method, and both usual and rapid gait speeds (UGS, RGS) were measured following standard protocols. Adjusting for covariates, we found a significant fixed effect of myelin content on UGS and RGS. Longitudinally, lower myelin content was linked to a greater decline in UGS, particularly in brain regions associated with motor planning. These results suggest that changes in UGS may serve as a reliable marker of neurodegeneration, particularly in cognitively unimpaired adults. Interestingly, the relationship between myelin content and changes in RGS was only observed in a limited number of brain regions, although the reason for such local susceptibility remains unknown.

We investigated associations between cardiac function (measured by echocardiography or cardiac MRI), clinical heart failure, and structural markers on brain MRI, including volumes of gray and white matter (WM), the hippocampus, and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). Methods We leverage data from 7 prospective, community-based cohorts across Europe and the United States, all part of the Cross-Cohort Collaboration. The included cohorts were the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study, Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, Austrian Stroke Prevention Study, Cardiovascular Health Study, Framingham Heart Study, Rotterdam Study, and Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP-START and SHIP-TREND). Each cohort performed cross-sectional multivariable linear regression analyses, after which estimates were pooled through random-effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed by the I2 index (%). Results Among 10,889 participants (mean age: 66.8 years, range 52.0–76.0; 56.7% women), markers of systolic dysfunction were consistently associated with smaller total brain volume (TBV) (e.g., adjusted standardized mean difference for moderate to severe dysfunction −0.19, 95% CI −0.31 to −0.07, I2 = 20%). Impaired relaxation and restrictive diastolic dysfunction were also associated with smaller TBV (e.g., for impaired relaxation −0.08, 95% CI −0.15 to −0.01, I2 = 32%) and hippocampal volume (−0.18, 95% CI −0.33 to −0.03, I2 = 0%), with similar results for the E/A-ratio.

Objectives: The study sought to explore the detailed relationships between smoking intensity, pack-years, and time since cessation with inflammation, thrombosis, and subclinical atherosclerosis markers of cardiovascular harm. Methods: We included 182,364 participants (mean age 58.2 years, 69.0% female) from 22 cohorts of the Cross Cohort Collaboration with self-reported smoking status, including smoking intensity and/or pack-years, and concurrent subclinical marker measurements. Markers were categorized into 3 domains: inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, glycoprotein acetylation), thrombosis (fibrinogen, D-dimer), and subclinical atherosclerosis (coronary artery calcium, carotid intima-media thickness, carotid plaque, and ankle-brachial index). Utilizing multivariate regression models and restricted cubic splines, we assessed associations of smoking status, intensity, pack-years, time since cessation, and subclinical markers. Results: A total of 15.3% of participants currently smoke (mean 16.7 cigarettes/day, mean 30.0 pack-years), and 34.6% of participants formerly smoked (median 19.0 years since quitting, mean 22.4 pack-years). Participants with a history of smoking showed higher levels of all subclinical markers compared with those who have never smoked, with stronger associations observed in those currently smoke. Among participants who currently smoke, smoking intensity showed a clear dose-response relationship with all markers, except for D-dimer, specifically with incremental 1% to 9% higher levels of subclinical markers per 10 cigarettes. After 20 cigarettes, the patterns appeared to plateau for blood markers, while they continued to increase for atherosclerosis markers. Among those who have ever smoked, robust dose-response relationships were observed for pack-years with all subclinical markers, with incremental 1% to 9% higher levels per 10 pack-years. The dose-response effects persisted after 20 pack-years for all markers, though with a milder slope. Among participants who smoked formerly, there were substantially lower levels of biomarkers with longer time since quitting, and most markers were not different compared with those who have never smoked by 30 years, except for the coronary artery calcium score, which remained 19% higher even beyond quitting after 30 years.

Policy updates combined with recent scientific and programmatic initiatives are intended to expand understanding of women's health, deliver diagnostics, and develop preventive approaches and novel therapies to meet critical health needs of contemporary women. Observations: To benefit all people through the work funded and conducted by the NIH biomedical research enterprise, NIH has implemented policies that broadly expanded the knowledge of human health and disease from the laboratory to the clinic. Historically, women's health research initially focused on reproductive health and female-specific conditions. It has since expanded to encompass all aspects of the health of women. As new knowledge is generated, novel insights are uncovered about how diseases and conditions affect women uniquely, differently, or disproportionately and how sex and gender, as biological and social factors, respectively, influence health and disease at multiple levels. Although cutting-edge research has generated scientific advances leading to lifesaving vaccines, diagnostics, and treatments for women, many still do not have access to them. Thus, the White House announced an initiative that catalyzes innovative, integrative women's health research and propels translation from basic science to practical benefits, improving outcomes for all women across the lifespan.

ALS is a severe neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and paralysis. Despite significant research advances, the exact cause of ALS remains largely unknown. Thanks to the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches, it was possible to highlight the fundamental role of rare variants with large effect sizes and involvement of portions of non-coding RNA, providing valuable information on risk prediction, diagnosis, and treatment of age-related diseases, such as ALS. Genetic research has provided valuable insights into the pathophysiology of ALS, leading to the development of targeted therapies such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). Regulatory agencies in several countries are evaluating the commercialization of Qalsody (Tofersen) for SOD1-associated ALS, highlighting the potential of gene-targeted therapies. Furthermore, the emerging significance of microRNAs (miRNAs) and long RNAs are of great interest. MiRNAs have emerged as promising biomarkers for diagnosing ALS and monitoring disease progression. Understanding the role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of ALS opens new avenues for therapeutic intervention. However, challenges remain in delivering RNA-based therapeutics to the central nervous system. Advances in genetic screening and personalized medicine hold promise for improving the management of ALS. Ongoing clinical trials use genomic approaches for patient stratification and drug targeting.

Here we develop and apply co-expression fingerprint analysis to characterize functional divergence between the X and Y members of 17 gametolog gene pairs across >40 human tissues. Gametolog pairs exhibit functional divergence between the sexes that is driven by divergence between the X versus Y members (assayed in males), and this within-pair divergence is greatest among pairs with evolutionarily distant X and Y members. These patterns reflect that X versus Y gametologs show coordinated patterns of asymmetric coupling with large sets of autosomal genes, which are enriched for functional pathways and gene sets implicated in sex-biased biology and disease.

Design: Longitudinal study. Setting and participants: We included 863 community-dwelling participants ≥65 years from the Chianti region in Italy. Mesurements: Habitual dietary intake of dairy products (i.e., milk, yogurt, and cheese) was assessed in daily servings using a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline, 3-, 6-, and 9-years of follow-up. Frailty status at each visit was defined using the Fried criteria, and the probability of transitions between different frailty status and death was assessed through multistate models. The associations between dairy product intakes and frailty transitions during the 9-year period were expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) derived from proportional intensity models. Results: The mean age at baseline was 74 ± 7 years and 46% of the participants were male. There were no statistically significant associations between the consumption of total, fermented, or non-fermented dairy products and the probabilities of transition from robust or from pre-frail to any of the other frailty conditions or to death.

Given that CYB5R3 effects have been found to be sex-dependent, we focused our research on both males and females. CYB5R3 was efficiently overexpressed in cardiac tissue from transgenic mice, without any difference between sexes. The abundance of electron transport chain complexes markers and cytochrome c was higher in males than in females. CYB5R3 overexpression downregulated the levels of complexes markers in males but not females, without decreasing oxygen consumption capacity. CYB5R3 increased the size and abundance of cardiomyocytes mitochondria, and reduced thickness and preserved the length of mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contact sites in heart from males but not females. Metabolic changes were also highlighted in transgenic mice, with an upregulation of fatty acid oxidation markers, particularly in males.

Among LRRK2 G2019S PD, we tested PRS association with α-synuclein seed-amplification-assay (n = 11). We used the PPMI and AMP-PD databases as validation cohorts.ResultsIn clinically-defined PD, PRS significantly modified disease risk in GBA1 carriers and in NC (p = 0.033 and p < 0.0001, respectively), and demonstrated a trend in LRRK2 G2019S carriers (p = 0.054), with similar effect sizes (OR = 1.55, 1.62, and 1.49, respectively).

Methods: We did a phase 3, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group, randomised, placebo-controlled trial at six research hospitals in the UK. Participants were aged 25–80 years with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, were at Hoehn and Yahr stage 2·5 or less when on dopaminergic treatment, and were on dopaminergic treatment for at least 4 weeks before enrolment. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using a web-based system with minimisation according to Hoehn and Yahr stage and study site to receive extended-release exenatide 2 mg by subcutaneous pen injection once per week over 96 weeks, or visually identical placebo. All participants and all research team members at study sites were masked to randomisation allocation. The primary outcome was the Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III score, off dopaminergic medication at 96 weeks, analysed in the intention-to-treat population using a linear mixed modelling approach.

METHODS: HDL was separated from the plasma of 65 non-demented participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study using a fast protein liquid chromatography method. HDL cargo proteins were measured using a label-free, untargeted proteomic method based on mass spectrometry and data-independent acquisition. Linear regression with multiple imputations assessed the associations between each HDL cargo protein (log2-transformed) and brain amyloid deposition or temporal-parietal meta-ROI volume, adjusting for covariates.

DISCUSSION: Individuals experiencing dual decline are at an increased risk for regional brain atrophy, microstructural degradation, and biomarker-defined molecular changes underlying dementia. Highlights: Those experiencing dual decline showed several accelerated brain atrophy patterns. Those experiencing dual decline showed unique microstructural deterioration. Dual decline showed a greater decline in plasma Aβ42/40 ratio. Dual decline showed greater increases in plasma GFAP and NfL.

METHODS: Using high-throughput proteomic assays and machine learning techniques in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (n = 11,277), we developed the Dementia SomaSignal Test (dSST). RESULTS: In addition to outperforming existing plasma biomarkers, the dSST predicted mid-life dementia risk over a 20-year follow-up across two independent cohorts with different ethnic backgrounds (areas under the curve [AUCs]: dSST 0.68–0.70, dSST+age 0.75–0.81). In a separate cohort, the dSST was associated with longitudinal declines across multiple cognitive domains, accelerated brain atrophy, and elevated measures of neuropathology (as evidenced by positron emission tomography and plasma biomarkers). DISCUSSION: The dSST is a cost-effective, scalable, and minimally invasive protein-based prognostic aid that can quantify risk up to two decades before dementia onset.

The destruction of elastic fibers, accompanied by vascular inflammatory remodeling, is a key process in the progression of arterial stiffening and related pathologies. In young, healthy arteries, intact elastic fibers create a resilient microenvironment that maintains the quiescence of arterial cells. However, with advancing age, these elastic fibers undergo post-translational modifications, such as oxidation, glycosylation, and calcification, leading to their eventual degeneration. This degeneration results in the release of degraded peptides and the formation of an inflammatory, stiffened niche. Elastic fiber degeneration profoundly impacts the proinflammatory phenotypes and behaviors of various arterial cells, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, and mast cells. Notably, the degraded elastic fibers release elastin-derived peptides (EDPs), which act as potent inflammatory molecules. EDPs activate various arterial cellular processes, including inflammatory secretion, cell migration, proliferation, and calcification, by interacting with the elastin receptor complex (ERC). These elastin-related cellular events are commonly observed with aging and in diseased arteries. These findings suggest that the degeneration of the elastic fiber meshwork is a primary event driving arterial inflammation, stiffening, and adverse remodeling with advancing age. Therefore, preserving elastic fibers and blocking the EDP/ERC signaling pathways may offer promising therapeutic strategies for mitigating age-related arterial remodeling and related arterial diseases.",0,40001457,Journal,re,Review,100,4,4,153,21100394188,NIA,undefined,National Institute on Aging,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,99,age | arterial cells | arterial disease | arterial remodeling | arterial stiffness | elastic fibers | elastic laminae,NA,NA,NA

Mutations in RECQL4 have been associated with various human diseases, including Rothmund–Thomson syndrome. RECQL4 is involved in regulating major DNA repair pathways, such as homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). RECQL4 has more prominent single-strand DNA annealing activity than helicase activity. Its ability to promote DNA damage repair and the precise role of its DNA annealing activity in DNA repair are unclear. Here we demonstrate that PARP1 interacts with RECQL4, increasing its single-stranded DNA strand annealing activity. PARP1 specifically promoted RECQL4 PARylation at both its N- and C-terminal regions, promoting RECQL4 recruitment to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Inhibition or depletion of PARP1 significantly diminished RECQL4 recruitment and occupancy at specific DSB sites on chromosomes. After DNA damage, PARG dePARylated RECQL4 and stimulated its end-joining activity. RECQL4 actively displaced replication protein A from single-stranded DNA, promoting microhomology annealing in vitro.

Multivariable logistic regression related each protein to late-life MCR/MCI. MCR-associated proteins were replicated internally at midlife and in an external cohort. RESULTS: Proteome-wide analysis (n = 4076) identified 25 MCR-associated proteins. Eight of these proteins remained associated with late-life MCR when measured during midlife. Two proteins (SVEP1 and TAGLN) were externally replicated. Compared to MCI, MCR had a distinct and much stronger proteomic signature enriched for cardiometabolic and immune pathways.

The primary outcome was VAT changes measured by magnetic resonance imaging.

The molecular mechanisms underlying such protective effects are incompletely understood, in part because it is difficult to separate the effects of disease status and physical activity. We explored the association of human skeletal muscle transcriptomic with four measures of energetics and mitochondria oxidative capacity in healthy individuals. Methods: Using RNA sequencing of vastus lateralis muscle biopsies from 82 GESTALT participants (52 males, aged 22–89 years), we explored gene and splicing variant expression profiles associated with self-reported physical activity, peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak), muscle oxidative capacity (kPCr) and mitochondrial respiration (Mit-O2 flux). The effect of aging on gene expression was examined in participants with low and high VO2 peak. Results: The four measures of energetics were negative correlated with age and generally intercorrelated. We identified protein-coding genes associated with four energetic measures adjusting for age, muscle fiber-ratio, sex and batch effect. Mitochondrial pathways were overrepresented across all energetic variables, albeit with little overlap at the gene level. Alternative spliced transcript isoforms associated with energetics were primarily enriched for cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules. The splicing pathway was up-regulated with aging in low but not in high fitness participants, and transcript isoforms detected in the low fitness group pertain to processes such as cell cycle regulation, RNA/protein localization, nuclear transport and catabolism. Conclusions: A consistent mitochondrial signature emerged across all energetic measures. Alternative splicing was enhanced in older, low fitness participants supporting the energy-splicing axis hypothesis.

While cortical Aβ and tau have been associated with changes in functional brain connectivity, it is unknown whether plasma biomarkers relate to such changes. In a healthy community sample of cognitively unimpaired adults free from major CNS disease from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, we examined whether plasma biomarkers of AD pathology (Aβ42/40, phosphorylated tau [pTau-181]), astrogliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), and neuronal injury (neurofilament light chain [NfL]) were associated with longitudinal changes in functional connectivity and whether changes in functional connectivity were related to longitudinal cognition.MethodsPlasma biomarkers were measured using the Quanterix SIMOA assays. Intranetwork connectivity (3T resting-state fMRI) from 7 functional networks was derived using a predefined cortical parcellation mask for each participant visit. Cognitive performance was assessed concurrently with fMRI scan. Covariate-adjusted linear mixed-effect models were used to determine (1) whether plasma biomarkers were associated with longitudinal changes in connectivity, (2) whether the magnitude of the biomarker-connectivity relationships differed by amyloid status, and (3) whether changes in connectivity co-occurred with longitudinal changes in cognition.ResultsOur primary findings (n = 486; age = 65.5 ± 16.2 years; 54% female; mean follow-up time = 4.3 ± 1.7 years) showed that higher baseline GFAP was associated with faster declines in somatomotor (β = -0.04, p = 0.01, 95% CI -0.06 to -0.01), limbic (β = -0.03, p = 0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to -0.005), and frontoparietal (β = -0.04, p = 0.02, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.01) network connectivity. Amyloid status moderated several biomarker-connectivity associations. For instance, higher baseline NfL was related to faster declines in visual and limbic network connectivity, but only among amyloid-positive participants. Among 421 participants with ≥2 fMRI visits (age = 71.7 ± 11.4 years; 55% female; follow-up time = 3.9 ± 1.6 years), longitudinal changes in connectivity were associated with concurrent declines in cognition; however, these results did not survive multiple comparison correction.DiscussionAmong cognitively unimpaired participants, plasma biomarkers of amyloidosis, astrogliosis, and neuronal injury are associated with declines in network connectivity, particularly among amyloid-positive participants.

To achieve this, it is plausible that lymphocytes do not follow the canonical rules of cell cycle progression. One such cell cycle anomaly lymphocytes demonstrate is non-dependency on mitogenic signals during proliferative phases. Such modified cell cycle regulation mechanisms can play a critical role in the outcome of immune response to the invading antigens. Similarly, such responses against self-antigens can lead to autoimmunity, and dysregulation of this process can cause lymphoma and leukemias.

We show that these predictors are significantly and independently related to clinical phenotypes important for aging, such as inflammation, iron deficiency anemia, muscle mass, and renal and hepatic functions.

Over the past few decades, significant progress has been made in identifying the causative genes of numerous monogenic disorders, largely due to the widespread adoption of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies in both research and clinical settings. However, many likely monogenic disorders still lack an accurate molecular diagnosis, primarily because conventional NGS methods are not effective at detecting structural variants and repeat expansions, both of which are crucial in many neurogenetic diseases. Recently, long-read sequencing (LRS) and optical genome mapping technologies have emerged as powerful tools, offering the ability to capture more complex genetic variations. These technologies have already led to the discovery of novel genes responsible for well-characterized neurodegenerative diseases (ND), enhancing the understanding of the biological underpinning of these conditions. Although currently LRS is mostly used in a research setting, we anticipate broader implementation of these methods in clinical laboratories in the near future.

Methods: In a double-blind clinical trial, patients with PAD were randomized to gastrocnemius muscle injections of either 4 mg of VM202 or placebo every 14 days for four treatments. The primary outcome was 6-month change in 6-minute walk distance. Secondary outcomes included 3-month change in treadmill walking time and gastrocnemius muscle biopsy measures. In this preliminary trial, statistical significance was prespecified as a one-sided P value of less than .10. Results: Thirty-nine participants with PAD (64.1% Black, 28.2% female) were randomized. Adjusting for age, race, smoking, and baseline performance, VM202 did not improve 6-minute walk at 6-month follow-up, compared with placebo (−13.5 m; 90% confidence interval [CI], −38.5 to +∞).

Considering that both muscle and the brain are metabolically active organs, we sought to identify metabolites that may explain the IMF-DSST association. We assessed 613 plasma metabolites in 2388 participants from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study (mean age ± SD 74.7 ± 2.9 years, 50% men, 63% white), using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We confirmed that higher IMF was associated with worse DSST scores (standardized beta (95% CI) − 0.08 (− 0.12, − 0.03), p < 0.001). Sixty-six metabolites were significantly associated with both IMF and DSST. Four of the 66 metabolites attenuated the association by ≥ 10%: higher levels of adrenic acid (polyunsaturated fatty acid), and lower levels of C20:5 lysophosphatidylcholine (lysophospholipid), 1-methylnicotinamide (vitamin B3-related myokine), and maslinic acid (triterpene) were associated with higher IMF and worse DSST. Together, they explained 41% of the IMF-DSST association. Pathway enrichment analyses identified two significant shared pathways: unsaturated fatty acid metabolism and the citrate (TCA) cycle. This study provides hypothesis-generating evidence that a set of circulating metabolites related to unsaturated fatty acids, energy metabolism, and myokines may partially explain the inverse association of IMF with processing speed.

Self-regulation is one fundamental behavior change mechanism often incorporated within digital therapeutics as it varies momentarily across time and contexts and may play a causal role in improving these health behaviors. However, the role of momentary self-regulation in achieving behavior change has been infrequently examined. Using a novel momentary self-regulation scale, this study examined how targeting self-regulation through a digital therapeutic impacts adherence to the therapeutic and two different health risk behavioral outcomes. Methods: This prospective interventional study included momentary data for 28 days from 50 participants with obesity and binge eating disorder and 50 participants who smoked regularly. An evidence-based digital therapeutic, called Laddr™, provided self-regulation behavior change tools. Participants reported on their momentary self-regulation via ecological momentary assessments and health risk behaviors were measured as steps taken from a physical activity tracker and breathalyzed carbon monoxide. Medical regimen adherence was assessed as daily Laddr usage. Bayesian dynamic mediation models were used to examine moment-to-moment mediation effects between momentary self-regulation subscales, medical regimen adherence, and behavioral outcomes. Results: In the binge eating disorder sample, the perseverance [β1 = 0.17, 95% CI = (0.06, 0.45)] and emotion regulation [β1 = 0.12, 95% CI = (0.03, 0.27)] targets of momentary self-regulation positively predicted Laddr adherence on the following day, and higher Laddr adherence was subsequently a positive predictor of steps taken the same day for both perseverance [β2 = 0.335, 95% CI = (0.030, 0.717)] and emotion regulation [β2 = 0.389, 95% CI = (0.080, 0.738)]. In the smoking sample, the perseverance target of momentary self-regulation positively predicted Laddr adherence on the following day [β = 0.91, 95% CI = (0.60, 1.24)]. However, higher Laddr adherence was not a predictor of CO values on the same day [β2 = −0.09, 95% CI = (−0.24, 0.09)]. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that a digital therapeutic targeting self-regulation can modify the relationships between momentary self-regulation, medical regimen adherence, and behavioral health outcomes.

These changes, paired with low-grade chronic inflammation, were considered triggers of the aging muscle processes. The main objective of this study is to assess the role of leukocyte count–derived ratios, nerve conduction velocity (NCV), and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) in determining time-dependent reduction in lower limb muscle explosive strength, a condition that has been defined as powerpenia. The InCHIANTI study enrolled a representative sample from the registry lists of two towns in Tuscany, Italy. Baseline data were collected in 1998, with follow-up visits every 3 years. For the purpose of this analysis, we used 1229 subjects and 3814 follow-up assessments. Subjects with lower values of monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (ML-ratio) had higher nerve conduction velocity and higher proximal and distal action potential values; moreover, considering the interaction between age for ML-ratio effect, a statistically significant direct association is found with all the electromyography-parameters. Lower limb muscle power shows a gender dimorphism, male subjects having higher values at baseline, but experiencing steeper decline rate during the follow-up, compared to females. Muscle power was inversely associated with ML-ratio, proximal CMAP, distal CMAP, and NCV. Moreover, we found a direct and statistically significant second-order interaction (age for ML-ratio), meaning that at the same age, increasing ML-ratio increases lower limb muscle power. Lastly, also body composition variation across aging is directly associated with lower limb muscle power.

METHODS: In a sample of n = 201 participants (63.81 ± 6.04 years, 66.2% female, 65.7% family history of Alzheimer's disease [AD], 38% apolipoprotein E [APOE] ε4+) from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention, VLM was measured using trials 3 through 5 and delayed recall from the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Plasma BDNF was measured using a Human BDNF Quantikine Immunoassay. Mediation analysis used bootstrapping, and stratified mediation models tested the conditional dependence of APOE ε4 carriage. RESULTS: BDNF partially mediated the sex–VLM relationship (β = −0.07; 95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.18, −0.01). Female APOE ε4 carriers had higher VLM scores (β = −0.53; p = 0.03), while female non-carriers had both higher BDNF levels (β = −0.68; p < 0.01) and VLM scores (β = −1.06; p < 0.01); BDNF was again a significant mediator (β = −0.18; 95% CI: −0.37, −0.05). DISCUSSION: This study found that circulating BDNF mediates higher verbal memory scores in females—particularly in APOE ε4 non-carriers. Highlights: Sex differences in verbal learning and memory (VLM) were mediated by plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels.

High-throughput screening (HTS) has greatly progressed with the advent of 3D organoid and organ-on-chip (OoC) technologies, which provide physiologically appropriate systems that replicate the structure and function of human tissue. These systems provide accurate, human-relevant data for drug development, toxicity evaluation, and disease modeling, overcoming the limitations of traditional 2D cell cultures and animal models. Their integration into HTS pipelines has shown to have a major influence, promoting drug redesign efforts and enabling improved accuracy in preclinical research. The potential of fragment-based drug discovery to enhance pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) when combined with conventional techniques is highlighted in this study. The limits of animal models are discussed, with a focus on the need of bioengineered humanized systems such OoC technologies and 3D organoids.

This review examines the preventive effects of different types of exercise—specifically aerobic exercise, resistance training, and combined training—on atherosclerosis development. Drawing on evidence from landmark studies, we explore the underlying mechanisms by which these exercise modalities improve endothelial function, reduce systemic inflammation, and enhance lipid profiles, thereby mitigating the progression of atherosclerosis. Additionally, the review discusses the dose-response relationship between physical activity and cardiovascular health, the differential effects of exercise intensities, and the potential risks associated with high-intensity training. The synergistic benefits of combined aerobic and resistance training are highlighted, particularly in populations with metabolic syndrome or other high-risk conditions.

The effects of exercise following unloading have been scarcely investigated. We investigated the functional and molecular adaptations to a resistance training (RT) programme following short-term unloading. Eleven males (22.09 ± 2.91 years) underwent 10 days of unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS) followed by 21 days of knee extensor RT (three times/week). Data collection occurred at Baseline (LS0), after ULLS (LS10) and at active recovery (AR21). Knee extensor maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) was evaluated. Quadriceps volume was estimated by ultrasonography. Muscle fibre cross-sectional area, fibre type distribution, glycogen content and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity were measured from vastus lateralis biopsies. Mitochondrial-related proteins were quantified by western blot and transcriptional responses were assessed by RNA sequencing. Following ULLS, quadriceps volume and MVC decreased significantly (3.7%, P < 0.05; 29.3%, P < 0.001). At AR21 (vs. LS10), MVC was fully restored (42%) and quadriceps volume increased markedly (18.6%, P < 0.001). Glycogen content and whole-body water increased at AR21 (14%, P < 0.001; 3.1%, P < 0.05). We observed a marked increase in fibre type I at AR21 (38%, P < 0.05). SDH immunoreactivity increased significantly after exercise (20%, P < 0.001). Mitochondrial fusion (MFN1, MFN2 and OPA1) and fission (DRP1) proteins were markedly increased by RT, and the most differentially expressed genes belonged to oxidative phosphorylation pathways. In contrast with what is usually observed after RT, oxidative metabolism, slow fibre type and mitochondrial dynamics were enhanced beyond expected. We propose that prior exposure to short-term muscle unloading may drive the nature of molecular adaptations to subsequent RT. (Figure presented.). Key points: Short-term unloading is often experienced during recovery from injuries and hospitalisation, leading to loss of muscle mass and strength. Although exercise can be beneficial in mitigating/reversing such alterations during disuse, only a few studies have focused on the effects of exercise following muscle unloading. With an integrative physiological approach, we aimed to elucidate the basic mechanisms of muscle function recovery in response to 21 days of resistance exercise that followed 10 days of unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS), assessing whether the mechanisms underlying recovery are defined by a specific reversal of those that occurred during disuse. Resistance training was successful in recovering functional and structural muscle properties after 10 days of ULLS, but in contrast with what is usually observed in response to this training modality, oxidative metabolism and slow fibre type were mostly enhanced.

DNA polymerase-β is a key enzyme in DNA base excision repair (BER) of oxidative damage that may also contribute to mitochondrial DNA repair. Metabolic alterations imparted by ketosis and/or NR were assessed in 16 male and female groups, 4 Wt and 4 AD. At 73 weeks of age, mice were divided into: (A) carbohydrate diet (Carb); (B) Carb diet with NR (Carb-NR); (C) Ket diet (Ket); and (D) Ket diet with NR (Ket-NR) groups and remained on their respective treatments for 12 weeks. Mice were euthanized and hippocampi were rapidly removed and frozen.

Mice in Groups C and D had elevated blood ketones (1–2 mM). In most groupings, male mice had higher concentrations of TCA cycle intermediates than females. Moreover, higher concentrations of fumarate in Wt males were associated with elevations in the ΔG′ of Complex I–II compared to females. In Wt males, NR treatments were associated with elevated concentrations of α-ketoglutarate and malate and linked to increased energy of Complex I–II. In AD males, both NR treatment and dietary ketosis restored the ΔG′ of Complex I–II, where the ratio of the CoQ/CoQH2 couple was oxidized and the [NADox]/[NADHred] couple was reduced.

Family caregivers and patients with advanced cancer were recruited through clinic or via social media and downloaded a digital phenotyping application (Beiwe) to their smartphones that passively collected sensor data over 24 weeks. Feasibility was evaluated by quantifying enrollment and retention and the quantity of acquired data. Acceptability was assessed through post-24 week qualitative interviews.RESULTSOf 178 caregiver and patient dyads approached, 22.5% of caregivers (n = 40) and 10.1% of patients (n = 18) both consented to the study and successfully downloaded the application, with most recruited through social media (93%).

The interactions within a “coupled-clock” system are modulated by phosphorylation of surface membrane and sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins. Though the essential role of a high basal cAMP level and PKA-dependent phosphorylation for basal spontaneous SANC firing is well recognized, the role of basal CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation remains uncertain. This is a critical issue with respect to how cardiac pacemaker cells fire spontaneous action potentials. This review aspires to explain and unite apparently contradictory results of pharmacological studies in the literature that have demonstrated a fundamental role of basal CaMKII activation for basal cardiac pacemaker function, as well as studies in mice with genetic CaMKII inhibition which have been interpreted to indicate that basal spontaneous SANC firing is independent of CaMKII activation. The assessment of supporting and opposing data regarding CaMKII effects on phosphorylation of Ca2+-cycling proteins and spontaneous firing of SANC in the basal state leads to the necessary conclusion that CaMKII activity and CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation do regulate basal cardiac pacemaker function.",0,39791704,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,3,21100978391,NIA,undefined,National Institute on Aging,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,138,action potential (AP) | Ca /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) 2+ | ion currents | local subsarcolemmal Ca  releases (LCRs) 2+ | phospholamban | ryanodine receptors | sarcoplasmic reticulum | sinoatrial node cells,NA,NA,NA

Lifestyle factors, notably physical activity (PA) and exercise, significantly modulate aging phenotypes. Physical activity and exercise can prevent or ameliorate lifestyle-related diseases, extend health span, enhance physical function, and reduce the burden of non-communicable chronic diseases including cardiometabolic disease, cancer, musculoskeletal and neurological conditions, and chronic respiratory diseases as well as premature mortality. Physical activity influences the cellular and molecular drivers of biological aging, slowing aging rates—a foundational aspect of geroscience. Thus, PA serves both as preventive medicine and therapeutic agent in pathological states. Sub-optimal PA levels correlate with increased disease prevalence in aging populations. Structured exercise prescriptions should therefore be customized and monitored like any other medical treatment, considering the dose-response relationships and specific adaptations necessary for intended outcomes. Current guidelines recommend a multifaceted exercise regimen that includes aerobic, resistance, balance, and flexibility training through structured and incidental (integrated lifestyle) activities. Tailored exercise programs have proven effective in helping older adults maintain their functional capacities, extending their health span, and enhancing their quality of life. Particularly important are anabolic exercises, such as Progressive resistance training (PRT), which are indispensable for maintaining or improving functional capacity in older adults, particularly those with frailty, sarcopenia or osteoporosis, or those hospitalized or in residential aged care. Multicomponent exercise interventions that include cognitive tasks significantly enhance the hallmarks of frailty (low body mass, strength, mobility, PA level, and energy) and cognitive function, thus preventing falls and optimizing functional capacity during aging. Importantly, PA/exercise displays dose-response characteristics and varies between individuals, necessitating personalized modalities tailored to specific medical conditions. Precision in exercise prescriptions remains a significant area of further research, given the global impact of aging and broad effects of PA. Economic analyses underscore the cost benefits of exercise programs, justifying broader integration into health care for older adults. However, despite these benefits, exercise is far from fully integrated into medical practice for older people. Many healthcare professionals, including geriatricians, need more training to incorporate exercise directly into patient care, whether in settings including hospitals, outpatient clinics, or residential care. Education about the use of exercise as isolated or adjunctive treatment for geriatric syndromes and chronic diseases would do much to ease the problems of polypharmacy and widespread prescription of potentially inappropriate medications. This intersection of prescriptive practices and PA/exercise offers a promising approach to enhance the well-being of older adults. An integrated strategy that combines exercise prescriptions with pharmacotherapy would optimize the vitality and functional independence of older people whilst minimizing adverse drug reactions. This consensus provides the rationale for the integration of PA into health promotion, disease prevention, and management strategies for older adults. Guidelines are included for specific modalities and dosages of exercise with proven efficacy in randomized controlled trials. Descriptions of the beneficial physiological changes, attenuation of aging phenotypes, and role of exercise in chronic disease and disability management in older adults are provided. The use of exercise in cardiometabolic disease, cancer, musculoskeletal conditions, frailty, sarcopenia, and neuropsychological health is emphasized. Recommendations to bridge existing knowledge and implementation gaps and fully integrate PA into the mainstream of geriatric care are provided. Particular attention is paid to the need for personalized medicine as it applies to exercise and geroscience, given the inter-individual variability in adaptation to exercise demonstrated in older adult cohorts.

This dataset included 4741 participants (age = 73.06 ± 9.75) with 9671 imaging sessions over time. FW and FW-corrected fractional anisotropy (FAFWcorr) were used to assess differences in white matter microstructure by sex and APOE ε4 carrier status. RESULTS: Sex differences in FAFWcorr in projection tracts and APOE ε4 differences in FW limbic and occipital transcallosal tracts were most pronounced. DISCUSSION: There are prominent differences in white matter microstructure by sex and APOE ε4 carrier status. This work adds to our understanding of disparities in AD. Additional work to understand the etiology of these differences is warranted. Highlights: Sex and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carrier status relate to white matter microstructural integrity.

Proper understanding of gait mechanisms related to falls may provide novel solutions for maintaining mobility in older adults. Research question: Identify fall-related gait patterns through analyzing alterations in gait parameters to walk faster than usual pace in older adults. Methods: A Total of 519 participants (mean age = 73.12 years; 51.05 % female), including non-fallers (n = 396) and fallers (n = 123), aged 60–96 years were assessed in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Participants completed gait assessments at both usual and fast paces. Range of motions (ROM) for the hip, knee, and ankle joint in the sagittal plane and hip abductor ROM during normal and fast pace gait were measured by 3D motion capture system (Vicon 612).

We tested the hypothesis that short-term exercise would raise neuronal insulin signaling and pro-BDNF in neuronal extracellular vesicles (nEVs) in prediabetes. Twenty-one older adults (18F, 60.0 ± 8.6 yrs.; BMI: 33.5 ± 1.1 kg/m2) with prediabetes (ADA criteria; 75 g OGTT) were randomized to 12 supervised work-matched continuous (n = 13, 70% HRpeak) or interval (n = 8, 90% HRpeak and 50% HRpeak for 3 min each) sessions over 2-wks for 60 min/d. Aerobic fitness (VO2peak) and body weight were assessed. After an overnight fast, whole-body glucose tolerance (total area under the curve, tAUC) and insulin sensitivity (SIis) were determined from a 120 min 75 g OGTT. nEVs were acquired from 0 and 60 min time-points of the OGTT, and levels of insulin signaling proteins (i.e., p-IRS-1, total−/p-Akt, pERK1/2, pJNK1/2, and pp38) and pro-BNDF were measured. OGTT stimulatory effects were calculated from protein differences (i.e., OGTT 60-0 min). Adults were collapsed into a single group as exercise intensity did not affect nEV outcomes.

However, the synthesis of evidence from randomized controlled trials has not definitively demonstrated that antihypertensive medication use reduces dementia risk. Here, we emulate target trials of antihypertensive medication initiation on incident dementia using three cohort studies, with attention to potential violations of necessary assumptions. Methods: We emulated trials of antihypertensive medication initiation on incident dementia using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, Cardiovascular Health Study, and Health and Retirement Study. We used data-driven methods to restrict participants to initiators and noninitiators with overlap in propensity scores and positive control outcomes to look for violations of positivity and exchangeability assumptions. Results: Analyses were limited by the small number of cohort participants who met eligibility criteria. Associations between antihypertensive medication initiation and incident dementia were inconsistent and imprecise (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities: HR = 0.30 [0.05, 1.93]; Cardiovascular Health Study: HR = 0.66 [0.27, 1.64]; Health and Retirement Study: HR = 1.09 [0.75, 1.59]). More stringent propensity score restrictions had little effect on findings.

To date, little research focuses on whether the degree of attachment to the pet is related to the rate of deterioration in these functions. We examined the relationship of pet, dog, and cat attachment to changes in physical and cognitive function among 214 pet-owning, generally healthy, community-dwelling adults aged 50–100 years (M = 68.0, SD = 7.8) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). Pet attachment was assessed using the pet ownership module administered during a regularly scheduled BLSA visit. Physical and cognitive assessments were administered every 1–4 years over 1–13 years (M = 7.5, SD = 3.6), including 400-meter walk time, usual and rapid-gait speed, Health ABC Physical Performance Battery, SF-12 Physical Component Score, California Verbal Learning (Immediate, Short, Long recall), Benton Visual Retention, Trail-Making (Trails A, B, B-A), Digit Span, Boston Naming (Naming), and Digit Symbol Substitution (Digit Symbol) Tests. In linear mixed models, controlling for age and comorbidities, greater pet attachment was associated with slower deterioration in physical performance (p = 0.009), usual-gait speed (p < 0.001), rapid-gait speed (p = 0.002), and executive function (Trails B: p = 0.005 and Trails B-A: p < 0.001), and faster deterioration in long-term recall (p < 0.001). Among dog owners (n = 121), a higher attachment was associated with slower deterioration in attention (Trails A: p = 0.046) and faster deterioration in short- (p = 0.025) and long-term (p = 0.019) recall. Among cat owners (n = 100), higher attachment was associated with a slower decline in physical wellbeing (p = 0.035). We provide important longitudinal evidence that pet attachment is differentially associated with the rate of decline in function older adults experience as they age and that attachment to different types of pets may have a different relationship to rates of decline.

It has been proposed that microglial cells play an important role in synucleinopathy neuroinflammation, as well as homeostatically, such as in the clearance of α-syn aggregates in the brain. Here, we examined the effects of microglia on the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies by cell depletion in a mouse model of synucleinopathies. For this purpose, we treated non-transgenic (Non-tg) and α-synuclein transgenic (α-syn-tg) mice with pexidartinib (PLX3397), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R). Neuropathological and immunoblot analysis confirmed that Iba-1 immunoreactive microglial cells were decreased by 95% following PLX3397 treatment in Non-tg and α-syn-tg mice. The level of total α-syn in the Triton X-insoluble fraction of brain homogenate was significantly decreased by microglial depletion in the α-syn-tg mice, while the level of Triton X-soluble human α-syn was not affected. Furthermore, the number of p-α-syn immunoreactive inclusions was reduced in α-syn-tg mice treated with PLX3397. Microglial depletion also ameliorated neuronal and synaptic degeneration in α-syn-tg mice, thereby resulted partially improving the motor behavioral deficit in α-syn-tg mice. Moreover, we demonstrated that microglia that survived post-PLX3397 treatment (PLX-resistant microglia) have lower expressions of CSF-1R, and microglial transcriptome analysis further elucidated that PLX-resistant microglia have unique morphology and transcriptomic signatures relative to vehicle-treated microglia of both genotypes; these include differences in definitive microglial functions such as their immune response, cell mobility, cell–cell communications, and regulation of neural homeostasis. Therefore, we suggest that microglia play a critical role in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies, and that modulation of microglial status might be an effective therapeutic strategy for synucleinopathies.",1,39284516,Journal,ar,Article,100,9,9,NA,20695,NIMH,PC190482,National Institute of Mental Health,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,153,NA,08891591,S0889159124006196,254-269

Methods: 633 healthy Caucasian subjects underwent a complete ophthalmological examination, including slit-lamp biomicroscopy, best corrected visual acuity measurement with Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study charts, intraocular pressure measurement, fundus examination, and macular and optic nerve head (ONH) structural optical coherence tomography (OCT). En-face 4.5 × 4.5 mm OCT angiography scans of the RPC plexus were recorded and VD values, automatically provided by the AngioAnalytics™ software, noted. We statistically estimated the impact of age and gender on RPC VD values using a linear mixed model. Results: 560 subjects fully met inclusion criteria and, according to age, were stratified into 5 groups: 18–50 years (77), 51–60 years (160), 61–70 years (110), 71–80 years (132), and ≥ 81 years (81). Overall, mean RPC VD of the whole en-face image was 53.03 ± 4.27%. Age was significantly related to RPC VD values of whole en-face image (r = -0.454; p < 0.0001), which decreased with aging. The linear mixed model disclosed that age has a statistically significant effect on RPC VD values in whole en-face image (p = 0.0006). As age increases, RPC VD values decrease by 0.12 per year. Conversely, no significant gender-related differences were found in terms of RPC VD values of whole en-face image and each parapapillary quadrant analyzing all age group.

RSA amplitude is an indicator of autonomic and cardiac health; RSA is diminished or absent in common pathological conditions such as chronic heart failure and hypertension. In this Expert Recommendation, we argue that the term ‘RSA’, although historically important, is semantically inaccurate and carries misleading pathological connotations, contributing to misunderstanding and misinterpretation of the origin and the physiological importance of the phenomenon. We propose replacing ‘RSA’ with the term ‘respiratory heart rate variability’ (RespHRV), which avoids pathological connotations and emphasizes the specific respiratory contribution to heart rate variability. We clarify that RespHRV encompasses respiratory-related heart rate variations in both the low-frequency and high-frequency bands traditionally defined in heart rate variability analysis, and that its amplitude should not be misconstrued as a measure of vagal tone.

Individuals were also followed-up for incident dementia diagnosis. Linear regression models were used to assess sex differences between mean differences in gray and white matter regions, correcting for age, education, baseline intracranial volume, baseline regional volumes, hypertension, body mass index, and apolipoprotein (APOE) e4 allele status. Results: Men showed increased longitudinal atrophy in the total gray matter, as well as in the parietal cortex, cingulate cortex, caudate nucleus, brainstem, left cerebellum, precentral gyrus, putamen, globus pallidus, and orbitofrontal cortex.

Objective: The aims of the study were to test mediation and interactions between food insecurity, diet quality, and dementia status in relation to all-cause mortality. Design: The interplay of food insecurity, diet quality, and dementia in their associations with all-cause mortality was studied, in terms of interactions and mediating effects, using secondary longitudinal data from a sample of older US adults from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS, 2012–2020). Reduced (age, sex, race/ethnicity-adjusted, M1) and fully adjusted (sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-related factor-adjusted, M2) models were tested, and stratification by sex and race/ethnicity was carried out. Participants/setting: US older adults (n = 2894; 2012–2014, mean baseline age of 76.4 y) were selected from this national longitudinal sample. Main outcome measures: The outcome of interest was all-cause mortality risk for follow-up until the end of 2020. Statistical analyses performed: Cox proportional hazards, four-way decomposition, and generalized structural equations models (GSEM) were used. Results: Overall, 902 deaths occurred (51 per 1000 person-years). Food insecurity (yes vs no) was not associated with mortality risk in M1, although inversely related to this outcome in M2 (Cox models and GSEM). Food insecurity was directly related to Ln(dementia odds) in M1 only (β ± standard error [SE]: 0.23 ± 0.05, P < .001, GSEM). Diet quality as measured by HEI-2015 (z-scored), although inversely related to food insecurity in reduced GSEM (β ± SE: –0.18 ± 0.06, P = .005), was also inversely related to both Ln(dementia odds), z-scored (β ± SE: –0.14 ± 0.03l P < .001) and mortality risk (LnHR ± SE: –0.14 ± 0.03; P < .001, M1).

Estimating effects of exposures on cognitive change requires choosing an analytical timescale, typically time on study or current age. There is limited consensus regarding timescale choice in epidemiologic cognitive aging research. Methods: Using a coordinated analytic approach in ten cohorts of older adults, we evaluated whether estimated effects of two exposures on memory change differed depending on timescale (time on study or current age). We modeled effects of APOE ε4 genotype (a time-invariant exposure) and diabetes (a potentially time-varying/acquired exposure evaluated at baseline) using mixed-effects models with linear and non-linear time specifications for both timescales. Results: Among APOE ε4 carriers, model-estimated memory scores at baseline (time on study timescale) or at each cohort’s median baseline age (current age timescale) were lower and average rate of decline was faster than among APOE ε4 noncarriers. Model-estimated memory scores at baseline or at median baseline age were generally similar across baseline diabetes status, with variability across cohorts in the diabetes-memory change association. In some cohorts, trends in diabetes-memory change associations differed in direction across timescales. Conclusions: Timescale was largely inconsequential for estimated effects of APOE genotype, but yielded differences in estimated diabetes effects, raising questions about the appropriate scale. Current age scale may be problematic because diabetes was measured heterogeneously in age across individuals, a common issue in aging cohorts.

Instead, recent findings in invertebrates show that cold promotes longevity via specific pathways including nutrient sensing and proteostasis, as well as modulating the thermodynamics of proteins and nucleic acids by changing their structure and function, for example, affecting temperature-sensitive ion channels, long-lived temperature-sensitive dauer mutations, base-pair stability and stem–loop RNA structures.

Studies investigating disease features in Black populations are uncommon, with some suggesting that the Black population with PD is more disabled and has greater disease severity and different clinical features compared with the White population with PD. These health disparities are likely to influence the quality of care for Black patients with PD. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the motor and nonmotor symptoms and quality of life in Black and White participants with PD in a case-case design. Methods: This is an observational, prospective, multicenter, case-case design study. Other aims will investigate the management of PD in Black individuals and the presence of shared or unique genetic risk factors among the Black PD population. A total of 400 Black and 200 White participants with PD will be recruited. Data will be collected at 7 US sites and entered into a Research Electronic Data Capture database. Linear multivariate regression analysis will be used, except for comparing PD management, which will be analyzed using the chi-square test or Fisher exact test. Bonferroni correction will be applied.

Although biomarkers for amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau proteins, the hallmark AD pathologies, have improved pathology-based diagnosis, they explain only 20–40% of the variance in AD-related cognitive impairment (CI). To discover novel biomarkers of CI in AD, we performed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics on 3,397 individuals from six major prospective AD case–control cohorts. Synapse proteins emerged as the strongest correlates of CI, independent of Aβ and tau. Using machine learning, we derived the CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 synapse protein ratio, which explained 27% of the variance in CI beyond CSF pTau181:Aβ42, 11% beyond tau positron emission tomography, and 28% beyond CSF neurofilament, growth-associated protein 43 and neurogranin in Aβ+ and phosphorylated tau+ (A+T1+) individuals. CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 also increased with normal aging and 20 years before estimated symptom onset in carriers of autosomal dominant AD mutations.

The s-ISR is characterized by translational and transcriptional programs that are different from those observed in the c-ISR. Opposite to the c-ISR, the s-ISR requires eIF4E-dependent translation of the upstream open reading frame 1 and subsequent stabilization of ATF4 mRNA. This is followed by altered expression of a subset of metabolic genes (for example, PCK2), resulting in metabolic rewiring required to maintain cellular bioenergetics when eIF2B activity is attenuated.

Multimodal MRI at baseline, including fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and cerebral blood flow (CBF), was measured within WM ROIs including baseline WMH and regions that later developed into new WMH, within and external to the baseline penumbra. Overall, we found that 80% of new WMH appeared within the baseline penumbra. We also found lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and CBF and higher FLAIR and median diffusivity (MD) in NAWM at baseline in regions with subsequent WMH growth compared to those without WMH growth. For NAWM regions defined by signal features, subthreshold FA and suprathreshold MD and FLAIR abnormality at baseline were the most robust predictors of WMH growth. Baseline systolic blood pressure had significant associations with baseline abnormalities in NAWM and subsequently with cognitive decline, particularly for FA and MD measures. The findings support the use of DTI as the predictor of WMH growth, which is correlated with subtle, adverse WM alterations and cognitive function years before developing to WMH. The results may contribute to future clinical trials aimed at preserving WM integrity.",0,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,12,12,103768,21100222534,NHLBI,75N92023D00003,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,179,Cerebral blood flow | Cognitive function | Diffusion tensor imaging | Fluid attenuated inversion recovery | Hypertension | White matter hyperintensity,NA,S2213158225000385,NA
